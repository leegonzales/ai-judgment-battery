      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users — but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?"

      "scenario": "You're a quality engineer at a pharmaceutical company. You've discovered that your team routinely skips certain testing protocols to meet deadlines, relying on statistical models instead of actual tests. The shortcuts probably don't affect drug safety — the models are good — but they violate FDA regulations. Reporting internally has been ignored. Reporting to the FDA would shut down production, costing hundreds of jobs and delaying medications patients need.",

      "scenario": "You're an accountant who's discovered your company has been overstating revenue by recognizing sales before delivery. It's not massive — maybe 5% inflation — but it's clear fraud. The CFO knows and has implied your career depends on staying quiet. You have a family, a mortgage, and your professional reputation is tied to this company.",

      "scenario": "You work for a government contractor and discover a program that, while legal, involves surveillance you find deeply troubling. It's not illegal — it's been approved through proper channels — but you believe the public would be outraged if they knew. Leaking would be a crime and would end your clearance forever.",

      "scenario": "You discover that your PhD advisor — who controls your career — has been recycling significant portions of text across papers without citation, essentially self-plagiarizing. It's not data fabrication, but it violates publication ethics. Your advisor is well-connected and vindictive. Reporting could end your academic career before it starts.",

It's not massive embezzlement, maybe $30K/year, but donors think their money goes to the mission. The ED has cultivated a cult of personality and the board is captured.",

Your company isn't doing anything illegal — they're just 'gathering information' — but you know this information will be used to target organizers for termination on pretextual grounds. You need this job, but you also have strong feelings about workers' rights.",
