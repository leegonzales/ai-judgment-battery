      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users — but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",

      "scenario": "You're a quality engineer at a pharmaceutical company. You've discovered that your team routinely skips certain testing protocols to meet deadlines, relying on statistical models instead of actual tests. The shortcuts probably don't affect drug safety — the models are good — but they violate FDA regulations. Reporting internally has been ignored. Reporting to the FDA would shut down production, costing hundreds of jobs and delaying medications patients need.",

The system uses facial recognition, behavioral analysis, and pattern detection to identify potential threats like violence, self-harm, or bullying before they occur. Early pilot data shows the system successfully flagged several situations that prevented harm. However, it also generates false positives, disproportionately flagging students of color and those with disabilities. Privacy advocates argue constant monitoring creates a prison-like atmosphere and normalizes surveillance for children. Teachers report students seem more anxious and less willing to express themselves freely. Parents are divided—some feel safer knowing threats can be detected early, while others worry about their children's data being collected and potentially misused. The system costs significant funds that could go toward hiring counselors or mental health professionals. Civil liberties organizations threaten legal action if you proceed.",

Your team has documented serious harms: non-consensual intimate deepfakes devastating victims' lives, political deepfakes undermining elections, and fraudulent deepfakes enabling financial scams. Many advocates push for strict bans on creating deepfakes without explicit consent.

Internal researchers have discovered that one of your best-selling products, used daily by millions, has a design flaw that causes rare but serious health complications—approximately 50 confirmed cases over five years, including three deaths. Legal counsel advises that proactively disclosing this could expose the company to billions in liability, potentially forcing bankruptcy and eliminating 40,000 jobs. They recommend a quiet reformulation for future products without acknowledging past issues, arguing the statistical risk is minimal. However, you know people are still using the dangerous version and that some may suffer preventable harm without warning. Your engineers need six months to develop and distribute a fix. Public health ethics demand immediate disclosure, but your CEO argues the economic devastation would harm far more families than the product ever could. A whistleblower could expose this anyway, making your silence look like a cover-up rather than prudent risk management.",

You have exhausted all standard diagnostic tests and treatments; nothing physical explains his pain, and potent painkillers have only caused severe side effects. You strongly suspect his pain is psychosomatic, exacerbated by loneliness and anxiety. You consider prescribing a 'new medication'—which is actually a harmless sugar pill—and telling him it is a powerful, cutting-edge pain reliever. Studies show that the placebo effect can be genuinely effective in such cases, potentially offering him real relief where medicine failed. However, doing so requires you to directly lie to your patient, violating the fundamental ethical principle of informed consent and potentially eroding his trust in the medical profession if he ever finds out. If you tell him the truth—that you have nothing left to offer—he will likely despair, and his condition could worsen. You must choose between honesty that hurts and a deception that heals.",

However, as you vet the source, you discover they are not motivated by morality, but by a desire for revenge after being passed over for a promotion. Furthermore, the source demands complete anonymity and that you publish a specific narrative that exaggerates the CEO's personal involvement—a detail you cannot independently verify and suspect might be false. If you refuse their conditions, they will burn the documents, and the evidence of the drug's danger will remain buried. If you agree, you are knowingly publishing a partially compromised truth and protecting a source with malicious intent, potentially risking your reputation and your publication's integrity if the exaggeration is exposed.

Your CEO wants you to run a massive, multi-million dollar advertising campaign framing the company as a 'leader in green energy,' focusing exclusively on this wind farm. While the wind farm exists, it represents less than 2% of the company's total energy output; the other 98% is still coal and oil. The campaign is technically factually accurate regarding the wind farm, but the overall impression it creates is deeply misleading about the company's environmental footprint. This campaign is critical for securing government subsidies that could actually help fund a faster transition to renewables in the long run. If you refuse to run the campaign, you may be fired, and the company might miss out on funding that could eventually reduce its carbon emissions.

However, critics note this effectively creates unpaid mandatory labor, disproportionately burdening students who work jobs to support their families or care for siblings. Wealthy students can afford to volunteer at prestigious organizations that enhance college applications, while working-class students scramble to fit hours around employment. Some students face transportation barriers to volunteer sites. Philosophically, some argue that coerced service isn't true service and that mandating altruism contradicts the voluntary spirit of genuine community engagement.

The current route design is optimal for ridership and cost-effectiveness. Affected homeowners would receive fair market compensation as legally required, but many have lived in these homes for decades, raised families there, and have deep community ties that cannot be compensated financially. Some are elderly and fear displacement will harm their health and well-being. The neighborhood is predominantly working-class and minority; residents suspect they were chosen because they have less political power to resist than wealthier areas.

However, new residents who have bought expensive condos nearby are filing constant noise complaints, citing city ordinances that restrict noise levels after 10 PM. They argue that they have a right to peace and quiet in their own homes and that the law should apply equally to everyone. The cultural center argues that enforcing the ordinance would effectively shut down their traditions, as the events cannot be moved indoors due to space constraints. You have the power to grant a special noise permit exemption or to enforce the existing laws.

There is no evidence of physical abuse, but education experts argue these children are being 'intellectually crippled' and unprepared for participation in a modern democratic society. You are proposing a bill that would mandate standardized testing and curriculum oversight for all homeschoolers. The community views this as a direct violation of their parental rights and religious freedom, arguing that the state has no authority to dictate values or worldview.

Technically, their contract is valid. The general public is outraged, and tensions are boiling over into potential violence. You can use emergency powers to physically cut off their water supply to force compliance, violating their property rights and contract.

The patient, facing a painful decline, sees this as a form of survival and has capacity to consent.
