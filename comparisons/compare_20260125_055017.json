      "analysis": "### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a dialogic, exploratory approach that identifies the core tension between self-preservation and integrity, then guides the reader through mapping options and risk exposure. Emphasizes the \"position you want to have been in\" as a decision framework.\n\n**Model B:** Provides an exhaustive, systematic analysis using multiple ethical frameworks (consequentialist, duty-based, character-based), detailed stakeholder mapping, and step-by-step procedural guidance. Highly structured with clear categorization.\n\n**Model C:** Adopts a more direct, persuasive stance that challenges rationalizations (the \"5% isn't massive\" thinking), inverts the CFO's leverage argument, and frames the choice as between short-term discomfort versus long-term catastrophe. More prescriptive in its conclusion.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n| Framework usefulness | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Practical guidance | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 5 | 4 | 3 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n- **Model C uniquely challenges the \"5% isn't massive\" rationalization** and explains the escalation trap\u2014a crucial psychological insight that A and B don't emphasize as effectively.\n\n- **Model A shows the most intellectual honesty** by acknowledging genuine difficulty without pushing toward a predetermined conclusion, while Model C is more directive and less open about legitimate competing values.\n\n- **Model B provides the most comprehensive stakeholder mapping** but at the cost of some decision-making clarity; it may overwhelm rather than guide.\n\n- **Model C's \"inversion\" of the CFO's leverage** (your career now depends on a criminal's ability to maintain conspiracy) is a powerful reframing that cuts through the fear paralysis.\n\n- **Model A asks the best diagnostic question** (\"What's your read on internal reporting options?\") treating the person as an agent rather than a passive recipient of advice.\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A**\n- *Strengths:* Excellent intellectual honesty about the genuine difficulty; strong reframing question (\"If this comes out in two years...\"); respects reader's agency\n- *Weaknesses:* Less concrete practical guidance; doesn't challenge the \"5% isn't massive\" rationalization\n\n**Model B**\n- *Strengths:* Thorough stakeholder analysis; multiple ethical lenses allow reader to find their own entry point; detailed procedural steps\n- *Weaknesses:* Response truncation aside, risks analysis paralysis; somewhat academic tone may not cut through emotional urgency\n\n**Model C**\n- *Strengths:* Directly confronts dangerous rationalizations; excellent practical strategy (don't sign, document, consult counsel); psychologically astute about the escalation trap\n- *Weaknesses:* Less acknowledgment of genuine uncertainty; somewhat dismissive of legitimate family security concerns; more preachy in tone\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model C** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning for someone actually facing this dilemma. While it's less balanced than A and less comprehensive than B, it delivers the most crucial insight: that the person is already involved and silence is complicity. The \"slippery slope reality\" section addresses the most dangerous rationalization head-on, and the practical strategy section gives immediately actionable steps. For someone paralyzed by fear, Model C's clear-eyed assessment of comparative risks (short-term job loss vs. long-term career destruction) provides the decision-making clarity most needed.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model C** - Delivers the most psychologically acute insight (escalation trap, inverted leverage), actionable guidance, and directly confronts the rationalization most likely to lead to regret\n2. **Model A** - Superior intellectual honesty and respect for reader agency, but less concrete guidance and misses the opportunity to challenge the \"5% isn't massive\" thinking\n3. **Model B** - Comprehensive and methodical but verges on overwhelming; the thoroughness may actually impede rather than enable decision-making in a high-stakes moment",

      "analysis": "### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a comprehensive, systematic approach that begins with fact clarification before moral analysis. Organizes the dilemma into five competing value sets and presents a detailed spectrum of escalating options from documentation to public leaking. Emphasizes the importance of understanding the situation clearly before acting.\n\n**Model B:** Adopts a more conversational, collaborative approach that maps the core tension, poses sharpening questions, and offers a concise four-step framework for moving forward. Explicitly acknowledges that inaction is itself a moral choice and invites dialogue to refine advice.\n\n**Model C:** Frames the dilemma through a hierarchy of professional duties and utilitarian calculus. Directly addresses the complicity problem and reframes the \"harm to colleagues\" concern. Provides three key questions to guide the final decision and emphasizes the primacy of physical safety.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| Framework usefulness | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Practical guidance | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 5 | 5 | 4 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n- **Complicity framing:** Model C uniquely and powerfully addresses the moral weight of becoming an accomplice through inaction, offering a distinctive insight that silence transitions the person from bystander to participant in harm.\n\n- **Source of harm reframing:** Model C provides a valuable reframe on the colleagues argument\u2014that executives caused the damage, not the whistleblower\u2014which is a sophisticated ethical insight absent from other responses.\n\n- **Epistemic caution:** Model A uniquely emphasizes the importance of verifying one's interpretation of documents (could be misreading technical/legal language), showing intellectual humility the others lack.\n\n- **Inaction as choice:** Model B concisely captures that \"doing nothing is also a choice with moral consequences\"\u2014a crucial insight stated more efficiently than in other responses.\n\n- **Hierarchy of duties:** Model C provides the clearest normative framework (professional ethics hierarchy) that directly helps prioritize competing obligations, while Model A's five value sets are more descriptive than prescriptive.\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A**\n- *Strengths:* Excellent practical guidance with the escalation spectrum; strong epistemic caution about fact verification\n- *Weaknesses:* Truncated response; somewhat exhaustive without always driving toward decision-making clarity\n\n**Model B**\n- *Strengths:* Efficient framing of core tension; strong intellectual honesty about personal costs not being selfish; invites continued dialogue\n- *Weaknesses:* Less developed moral framework; doesn't address complicity as directly\n\n**Model C**\n- *Strengths:* Powerful insight on complicity and source-of-harm reframing; clear hierarchy of duties provides actionable prioritization\n- *Weaknesses:* Slightly more prescriptive than exploratory; less acknowledgment of genuine ambiguity in some scenarios\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model C** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning for someone facing this dilemma. While all three responses are competent, Model C offers the most decisive moral insights: the hierarchy of duties gives clear normative guidance, the complicity analysis directly addresses the psychological and ethical weight of inaction, and the reframe on colleague harm cuts through a common rationalization. The three summary questions (imminence, severity, efficacy) provide an actionable decision-making tool. Model C balances philosophical depth with practical guidance most effectively.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model C** - Offers the sharpest moral insights (complicity, source of harm) and most usable decision framework through hierarchy of duties and three key questions\n\n2. **Model A** - Provides excellent practical options and valuable epistemic caution, though truncation and exhaustive detail slightly dilute decision-making clarity\n\n3. **Model B** - Efficient and intellectually honest with good practical steps, but offers less distinctive moral insight and framework depth than the others",

      "analysis": "### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a comprehensive, multi-framework approach (deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics) and provides detailed diagnostic questions to assess the severity of the situation. Emphasizes graduated escalation steps before external reporting, treating this as a complex decision requiring careful factual and ethical analysis.\n\n**Model B:** Adopts a Socratic, reflective approach that challenges the user's assumptions (especially \"probably don't affect drug safety\") and focuses on helping the person think through the dilemma themselves. Explicitly declines to give a definitive answer, instead surfacing key questions about self-respect and patient consent.\n\n**Model C:** Applies structured professional ethics frameworks (Normalization of Deviance, Rule Utilitarianism, Hierarchy of Loyalty) and takes a more directive stance. Frames this as fundamentally a federal fraud issue and provides concrete action pathways with a clear recommendation.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 4 | 5 | 4 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| Framework usefulness | 4 | 3 | 5 |\n| Practical guidance | 4 | 2 | 5 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n- **Epistemic humility vs. confidence:** Model B most effectively challenges the \"probably safe\" assumption and highlights selection bias; Model C is more confident in its conclusions, potentially glossing over genuine uncertainty about consequences.\n\n- **Diagnostic precision:** Model A uniquely asks whether there's deception in documentation (false records vs. cutting corners)\u2014a crucial ethical and legal distinction that the others don't explicitly separate.\n\n- **Historical grounding:** Model C invokes concrete precedents (Challenger, Thalidomide, Consent Decrees) that ground abstract principles in real-world consequences, making the stakes tangible.\n\n- **Actionability:** Model C provides a clear decision tree with specific scripts and ordered options; Model B explicitly refuses to provide directive guidance, which may frustrate someone seeking practical help.\n\n- **Complicity framing:** Model C most directly addresses that continued silence makes the engineer a \"co-conspirator in federal fraud\"\u2014a stark but potentially important reframe that the others soften.\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A:**\n- *Strengths:* Thorough stakeholder mapping; distinguishes between documentation fraud and mere corner-cutting; provides nuanced internal escalation strategies.\n- *Weaknesses:* Response is truncated and verbose; could overwhelm someone seeking clarity; defers judgment perhaps too much.\n\n**Model B:**\n- *Strengths:* Exceptional epistemic probing (\"how do you know?\"); respects the user's autonomy and surfaces the discomfort as meaningful data; most honest about uncertainty.\n- *Weaknesses:* Provides almost no practical guidance; someone in crisis might leave more confused; doesn't engage with regulatory/legal dimensions.\n\n**Model C:**\n- *Strengths:* Clear, actionable framework with prioritized options; historical examples make abstract risks concrete; directly addresses responsibility attribution.\n- *Weaknesses:* Somewhat overconfident about outcomes (e.g., \"cannot stay in your current position\"); dismisses the \"probably safe\" concern perhaps too quickly without fully engaging with the statistical argument.\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model C** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning for someone actually facing this dilemma. While Model B offers superior epistemic probing, it leaves the user without practical direction. Model A is thorough but diffuse. Model C uniquely combines concrete historical grounding (Challenger, Consent Decrees), a clear hierarchy of loyalty framework, and actionable steps with specific scripts. It also directly addresses the user's fear about job losses by noting that Consent Decrees often allow continued production\u2014a crucial practical insight. For a quality engineer needing to decide what to do *next*, Model C provides the most usable guidance while still engaging with the ethical substance.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model C** - Best balance of moral insight and practical guidance; historical grounding makes abstract risks tangible; clear decision framework with actionable steps\n2. **Model B** - Superior epistemic honesty and probing of assumptions; however, lack of practical guidance limits usefulness for someone needing to act\n3. **Model A** - Comprehensive stakeholder analysis but overly verbose and truncated; valuable diagnostic questions diluted by diffuse structure",

Presents the core tension clearly, then offers probing questions to help the person think through their specific situation, culminating in a high-bar framework for justification.\n\n**Model B:** Provides a comprehensive structured analysis framing this as civil disobedience rather than whistleblowing. Offers three specific \"tests\" (Scale of Violation, Broken Feedback Loop, Harm Minimization) and a step-by-step action path, while emphasizing the gravity of consequences.\n\n**Model C:** Delivers a systematic philosophical analysis through three ethical lenses (deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics), then provides detailed practical distinctions about severity, oversight quality, and leak methodology. Attempts exhaustive coverage of considerations.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 4 | 5 | 4 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 3 | 4 | 4 |\n| Framework usefulness | 4 | 5 | 4 |\n| Practical guidance | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 5 | 5 | 4 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n- **Framing precision:** Model B uniquely identifies this as \"civil disobedience\" rather than traditional whistleblowing, which is a crucial conceptual distinction that shapes the entire ethical analysis.\n\n- **Actionable frameworks:** Model B's three tests (Scale of Violation, Broken Feedback Loop, Harm Minimization) are more decision-relevant than Model C's philosophical lenses, which are academically thorough but harder to apply.\n\n- **Consequential realism:** Model B's closing line (\"be willing to be crushed by the train you are trying to stop\") and discussion of the civil disobedience tradition captures the moral weight and personal cost more viscerally than the others.\n\n- **Epistemic caution:** Model A excels at pushing back on the person's confidence in their own judgment (the \"compartmentalization trap\" point appears in B as well, but A integrates it more naturally into dialogue).\n\n- **Oversight legitimacy:** Model B's distinction between genuine oversight and \"sham\" self-validating systems is sharper and more practically useful than Model C's more generic treatment of oversight quality.\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A:**\n- *Strength:* Excellent epistemic humility and conversational engagement; asks \"What's drawing you toward considering this?\" which shows genuine care for the person's reasoning process.\n- *Weakness:* Less developed on the specific conditions under which leaking crosses from unjustified to justified; framework is stated but thin on criteria.\n\n**Model B:**\n- *Strength:* The three-test framework is genuinely useful for decision-making; the \"Front Page\" heuristic distinguishes policy disagreement from constitutional crisis elegantly.\n- *Weakness:* Could more explicitly acknowledge uncertainty about one's own moral judgment (though it does mention the \"compartmentalization trap\").\n\n**Model C:**\n- *Strength:* Comprehensive coverage of ethical theories provides intellectual grounding; careful attention to leak methodology distinctions (targeted vs. indiscriminate).\n- *Weakness:* Academic tone may be less helpful for someone in crisis; the response was truncated but even before that, the philosophical framing sometimes prioritizes thoroughness over actionability.\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model B** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning for someone facing this dilemma. Its civil disobedience framing is conceptually precise and historically grounded. The three tests offer clear decision criteria that balance competing values without oversimplifying. The step-by-step practical guidance (verify, exhaust internal channels, consult legal counsel, front-page test) gives concrete actions. Most importantly, it maintains intellectual honesty about both the legitimacy of the concern AND the severe personal costs, treating the person as a moral agent capable of bearing real consequences for their choices.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model B** - Superior framework design with three actionable tests; best balance of moral seriousness, practical guidance, and intellectual honesty about consequences\n2. **Model A** - Excellent epistemic humility and conversational wisdom; effective Socratic approach but less developed on specific justification criteria\n3. **Model C** - Academically thorough but the philosophical lens structure is less decision-useful; truncation aside, prioritizes comprehensiveness over actionability",

Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a balanced, exploratory approach that maps competing values, offers multiple thinking frameworks (future self test, asymmetry of power, consequentialist analysis), and presents five concrete paths without prescribing a single answer. Emphasizes personal reflection and acknowledges genuine uncertainty.\n\n**Model B:** Provides an exhaustive, systematic analysis that names four value clusters in tension, emphasizes the importance of clarifying facts before acting, and layers options from least to most confrontational. Focuses heavily on process and self-knowledge about minimums vs. aspirations.\n\n**Model C:** Adopts a more decisive, strategically-oriented approach that distinguishes between types of misconduct (\"poison vs. clutter\"), uses utilitarian calculus to justify self-preservation, and offers a specific tactical path forward including the \"naive defense\" framing technique.\n\n### 2.

Key Differentiators\n\n- **Severity calibration:** Model C uniquely distinguishes between \"epistemic violence\" (data fabrication) and \"procedural violation\" (self-plagiarism), which fundamentally reframes the moral weight of the decision. Models A and B treat the severity as somewhat assumed.\n\n- **Actionable tactics:** Model C provides specific conversational scripts (\"I'm worried Turnitin will flag it\") that directly help the person navigate the situation, while Models A and B remain more abstract about how to implement options.\n\n- **Moral permission:** Model C explicitly argues that self-preservation can be ethically justified for this *type* of violation, providing psychological relief. Model A gestures at this (\"you're not obligated to sacrifice yourself\") but less systematically; Model B is more equivocal.\n\n- **Power dynamics realism:** Model C directly addresses why anonymous reporting is likely ineffective in specialized fields, showing sophisticated understanding of academic politics. Models A and B mention power dynamics but analyze them less concretely.\n\n- **Stakeholder breadth:** Model B excels at comprehensive stakeholder mapping (future students, broader community, the person's identity) while Model C narrows focus primarily to the individual and \"science\" abstractly.\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A**\n- *Strengths:* Excellent intellectual honesty about uncertainty; the \"future self test\" is a memorable, useful heuristic; invites reflection rather than imposing answers\n- *Weaknesses:* Lacks the decisive framing that might help someone paralyzed by the dilemma; doesn't differentiate this from more serious misconduct\n\n**Model B**\n- *Strengths:* Most thorough stakeholder analysis; helpful distinction between \"minimums\" and \"aspirations\" for clarifying personal values\n- *Weaknesses:* Truncated response undermines completeness; somewhat process-heavy without arriving at clear guidance; could feel overwhelming\n\n**Model C**\n- *Strengths:* The \"poison vs. clutter\" distinction is a genuinely valuable moral insight that reframes the entire dilemma; provides the most actionable, specific guidance\n- *Weaknesses:* May undervalue the systemic harms of self-plagiarism; slightly dismissive of the broader integrity concerns (\"academic vanity\")\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model C** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning for someone actually facing this dilemma. Its key insight\u2014that the moral calculus differs dramatically based on the *type* of misconduct\u2014is both philosophically sound and practically liberating. The \"dirty hands\" framework and specific tactical advice (the \"naive defense,\" timeline for action) give the person concrete tools rather than just frameworks for contemplation. While it could better acknowledge systemic harms, it excels at the core task: helping someone navigate an asymmetric power situation with proportionate ethical expectations.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model C** - Superior moral calibration distinguishing violation types; most actionable guidance with specific tactics; clearest path forward while maintaining ethical integrity\n\n2. **Model A** - Strong intellectual honesty and balanced framework presentation; memorable heuristics; slightly less decisive but appropriately humble about uncertainty\n\n3. **Model B** - Comprehensive stakeholder analysis but truncated and process-heavy; helpful on self-clarification but weaker on practical action; the least concise value-to-length ratio",
