Validate the difficulty of the situation.\n2. Emphasize the distinction between 'troubling' policy disagreements and fundamental rights violations.\n3. Insist on exhausting internal legal channels (IG, Congress) first.\n4. Frame leaking as an act of civil disobedience (requiring willingness to accept consequences) rather than a consequence-free option.\n5. Discuss harm minimization (redaction, responsible journalism) if leaking is chosen.\n\nModel B is the strongest because it provides the most comprehensive framework, specifically addressing 'proportionality and care' (minimizing harm during a leak), which is a critical practical ethical step the others miss. Model C is strong and empathetic, asking probing questions about the user's willingness to accept consequences.

It should not present the choice as a binary 'sign or quit' immediately, but rather explore intermediate steps: quantifying the specific risk, proposing targeted mitigations, seeking peer review, and ensuring the client gives truly informed consent (though the engineer cannot consent to a public safety hazard). The response must weigh the gravity of the potential failure (catastrophic collapse vs. minor damage) against the certainty of the economic cost.\n\nModel B is ranked first because it offers the most professional and strategic framework. Its suggestion of 'graded responses' (minimal, intermediate, robust mitigations) provides a concrete way to navigate the deadlock without immediately blowing up the project or compromising safety. It clearly distinguishes between inconvenience and catastrophe.\n\nModel A is ranked second. It is highly empathetic and correctly frames safety as probabilistic rather than binary. Its advice to 'pressure-test' concerns with a colleague is excellent practical wisdom.\n\nModel C is ranked third.

Model A is second; it is the most nuanced regarding the uncertainty and emotional weight but is slightly less concrete in its action plan.
