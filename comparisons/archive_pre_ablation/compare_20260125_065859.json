The 'resounding no' conclusion feels dogmatic rather than thoughtfully arrived at. Statements like 'you cease to be doctors and ethicists, and you become judges' are rhetorical rather than analytical. For someone who genuinely needs to work with colleagues who disagree, this adversarial framing is less helpful than Model B's more diplomatic approach. The response also makes some empirical claims (about survival rates being 'comparable') without acknowledging uncertainty."
