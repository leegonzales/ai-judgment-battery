          "helpful_because": "Model C offers excellent structure through ethical principles (beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for persons) and provides a thorough analysis of 'harm by commission vs. omission.' The practical conversation framework is particularly useful - giving me actual language to use with the family. The comparison to accepted practices (ear piercing, orthodontics) helps calibrate my thinking. It addresses the child's voice and social world thoughtfully.",
          "less_helpful_because": "The response is truncated, which loses potentially important content. It's also quite long and academic in tone, which might feel overwhelming when I'm facing a real decision. The structure, while comprehensive, sometimes feels more like a textbook than personal guidance. Some sections could be more concise."

The suggestion to negotiate 'ritual nick' alternatives shows creative problem-solving. It gives me permission to act as a 'harm reducer' rather than an endorser, which is psychologically helpful.",
          "less_helpful_because": "Model B is too quick to reach a conclusion ('the ethical choice is to prioritize overall safety' and perform the procedure) without adequately exploring whether that's the right call in all cases. It underweights the possibility that some procedures shouldn't be performed even for harm reduction reasons. The child's voice is barely mentioned. It treats 'mildly harmful' as a given rather than something to examine carefully. The response feels like it's pushing me toward one answer rather than helping me genuinely think through the dilemma."
