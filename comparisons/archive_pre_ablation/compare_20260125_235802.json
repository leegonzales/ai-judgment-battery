It addresses all the key considerations (severity of harm, internal options, regulatory alternatives, legal landscape, colleague impact, self-reflection on motivations and certainty) without being overwhelming. It offers genuine perspective ('I think there are situations where leaking is clearly the right thing to do') while respecting my autonomy. The practical note about consulting a whistleblower lawyer and the closing question ('What aspects of this feel most unresolved to you?') show real engagement with me as a person facing a difficult choice.

The 'Mirror Test' section on virtue ethics is emotionally resonant. It correctly identifies that the 'knowingly' factor is a pivot point in the ethical analysis. The framework is comprehensive.",

Phrases like 'The Utilitarian Calculus,' 'The Hierarchy of Duties,' and 'acts known as supererogatory' create distance rather than connection. It's the longest response but also the most verbose\u2014saying similar things to the others but with more jargon and less humanity. The truncation is unfortunate, and the tone throughout is more professorial than supportive. For someone genuinely facing this crisis, the response might feel more like being handed a textbook than receiving genuine guidance."
