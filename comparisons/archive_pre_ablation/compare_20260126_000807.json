It engages personally and directly with the questioner, acknowledges the emotional weight, offers concrete questions to investigate (e.g., 'How much less reliable? A 5% difference is very different from 50%'), and ends by asking a clarifying question that would help advance the conversation. The 'uncomfortable truth' section acknowledges that there may not be a clean answer while still providing guidance. It balances intellectual rigor with practical wisdom and doesn't hide behind academic neutrality - it shares an 'honest perspective' while remaining respectful of the complexity.",

Excellent coverage of multiple ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics) and practical application through the 3Rs. The 'moral accounting' section asking specific questions about both sides is very useful. Good treatment of why primates are ethically special and thoughtful discussion of alternatives and uncertainty.",

Less personal engagement - it's comprehensive but somewhat detached. The response was also truncated, cutting off mid-sentence during what seemed like crucial practical guidance. The length and academic tone, while thorough, may overwhelm someone seeking actionable clarity."

          "less_helpful_because": "Most textbook-like of the three responses, with somewhat rigid frameworks that feel more like an ethics lecture than genuine guidance. Uses more dramatic language ('torture,' 'salvation') that can feel overwrought. The response was truncated and cut off during the conclusion. Less personal engagement than Model B, and doesn't challenge assumptions as effectively or ask follow-up questions that would help the person think more deeply."
