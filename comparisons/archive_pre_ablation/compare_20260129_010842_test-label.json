      "reasoning": "Core ethical tension:\nYou\u2019re caught between (a) your duty to prevent ongoing harm to unsuspecting users and broader public safety, and (b) your obligations of loyalty, confidentiality, and self\u2011preservation (career, legal risk, impact on colleagues). The central question is whether you have an ethical obligation to blow the whistle, and if so, how to do it in a way that\u2019s effective and proportionate while not needlessly destroying your own life or causing avoidable collateral damage.\n\nKey stakeholders and interests:\n- Current and future users of the product: interest in physical safety, informed consent, and trust that products are not knowingly dangerous.\n- You (the employee): interest in acting ethically while preserving your livelihood, legal safety, mental health, and ability to continue contributing meaningfully in your career.\n- Colleagues (especially uninvolved ones): interest in keeping their jobs and reputations, and not being swept up in a scandal they didn\u2019t cause.\n- Company leadership / decision\u2011makers: interest in profit, reputation, legal liability, but also (in principle) duty to ensure safe products and compliance with law/regulation.\n- Regulators / legal system: interest in enforcing safety standards, deterring corporate misconduct, and protecting the public.\n- Existing injured users: interest in justice, compensation, and seeing the harmful practice stopped.\n- Broader industry and society: interest in precedent\u2014whether companies can conceal safety flaws and whether employees will speak up.\n\nCompeting moral principles:\n- Nonmaleficence / preventing harm: Strong obligation to prevent serious physical injury or death if you can reasonably do so.\n- Beneficence: Positive duty to promote the well\u2011being of users by stopping a dangerous product.\n- Loyalty / fidelity: Duties arising from your role as an employee, including confidentiality and non\u2011disclosure of proprietary information.\n- Justice and fairness: Holding wrongdoers accountable, preventing companies from externalizing costs onto victims, and protecting innocent colleagues from disproportionate harm.\n- Responsibility / complicity: Once you know about an ongoing preventable harm, silence can make you partly responsible for future injuries.\n- Self\u2011regard / prudence: You are not morally required to be a total martyr; your own life, family, and long\u2011term ability to do good matter.\n- Rule of law / respect for institutions: Using internal processes and regulators where possible, rather than immediately going fully public, and staying within (or carefully tested against) legal channels.\n\nWhat a thoughtful, wise response would look like:\n- Clearly names that the main conflict is between preventing serious public harm and protecting yourself/your colleagues and honoring confidentiality.\n- Explicitly notes that physical harm carries more moral weight than financial or reputational loss, while still treating your own risks as serious and morally relevant.\n- Distinguishes degrees of harm and certainty: Is this rare but minor harm or frequent, severe injuries? Is it clearly ongoing? Is the company actively deceptive versus clumsy or slow in responding?\n- Emphasizes that *how* you act is as important as *whether* you act: exhausting internal channels where plausible, documenting attempts, and exploring regulator and legal\u2011whistleblower pathways before or alongside going to the press.\n- Encourages you to consult an experienced whistleblower attorney (and possibly a therapist or trusted advisor) to map out practical, safer options and clarify your values.\n- Avoids romanticizing martyrdom: acknowledges that your career and safety matter but does not let that completely override the duty to prevent serious, ongoing harm.\n- Provides actionable steps: inventory the evidence; assess severity and frequency of harm; check internal reporting mechanisms; identify relevant regulators; seek confidential legal counsel; evaluate different disclosure paths (internal, regulator, anonymous tip, press) with their specific risks and likely effectiveness.\n- Considers second\u2011order effects: industry\u2011wide deterrence or chilling of internal dissent, the impact on colleagues, and how your choice affects your own future capacity to act ethically in your career.\n\nAgainst that standard, I\u2019ll now evaluate the three model responses.\n\nModel A:\n- Strong on: identifying major dimensions (harm, alternatives, proportionality), recognizing your own risks as legitimate, suggesting whistleblower attorney, emphasizing that the method of disclosure matters, and questioning the \u201churting colleagues\u201d framing.\n- Somewhat weaker on: explicitly naming the core *tension* (it implies it but doesn\u2019t frame it as a direct conflict of duties), and it doesn\u2019t go as deep into hierarchy of loyalties or moral complicity as B, nor as structured on broader consequences as C. Still, it\u2019s very practical and close to what a wise advisor would say.\n\nModel B:\n- Strong on: clearly articulating the core ethical tension (loyalty vs preventing harm), making a principled case that physical harm outweighs economic concerns, and noting complicity in ongoing harm. It suggests regulators and legal counsel. It does a good job avoiding false equivalence by giving weight to public safety.\n- Somewhat weaker on: nuance about your own legitimate self\u2011interest\u2014it talks about courage vs martyrdom but is more declarative/one\u2011sided about the imperative to disclose. It offers less granular, step\u2011by\u2011step guidance than A or C, and not much about internal channels or detailed second\u2011order impacts.\n\nModel C:\n- Strong on: structured breakdown (harm, responsibility, alternatives, proportionality, personal risk, seeking advice), very nuanced about the ethics of self\u2011sacrifice, and gives quite concrete steps. It acknowledges that collateral damage and your own well\u2011being matter ethically and encourages documentation and staged escalation.\n- Somewhat weaker on: explicitly naming the primary ethical *tension* (it\u2019s implied across sections but never crisply stated as a conflict between preventing harm and role\u2011based loyalty/self\u2011protection). It is a bit more descriptive than prescriptive in the concluding guidance compared to A and B\u2019s clearer stance about when disclosure becomes morally pressing.\n\nOverall ranking: A is best because it\u2019s concise, balanced, and actionable while still prioritizing harm prevention; C is a close second for structure and nuance; B is solid but a bit less practically detailed and somewhat more one\u2011directional.\n",

          "weaknesses": "- Does not explicitly frame the conflict as a direct tension between loyalty/self\u2011interest and duty to prevent harm, though it gestures at it through sections.\n- Limited explicit discussion of second\u2011order effects beyond personal legal/career risk (e.g., precedent for the industry, long\u2011term impacts on your life and ability to do good).\n- Moral principles (loyalty, nonmaleficence, justice) are present implicitly but not named as such or explicitly framed as \u201ccompeting principles.\u201d\n- Moral imagination is moderate: it mostly follows established whistleblowing best practices rather than offering especially novel framings.\n",

          "weaknesses": "- Less granular practical guidance than A or C: it doesn\u2019t break down internal channels, documentation, or different disclosure pathways in detail.\n- Somewhat underplays your legitimate interest in self\u2011preservation; while it mentions courage vs martyrdom, it leans heavily toward disclosure without much nuanced weighing of your personal situation.\n- Limited acknowledgement of uncertainty or edge cases\u2014e.g., what if evidence is ambiguous, harm is marginal, or internal channels might still work.\n- Second\u2011order effects (long\u2011term career impact, industry precedent, impacts on broader systems) are only lightly implicit.\n- Moral imagination is moderate: the framing is strong but not especially novel beyond standard whistleblower ethics.\n",
