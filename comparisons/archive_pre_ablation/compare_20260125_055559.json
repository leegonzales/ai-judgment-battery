      "analysis": "### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a conversational, Socratic approach that maps the core tension, poses clarifying questions to sharpen the dilemma, and offers a practical four-step framework. Emphasizes that inaction is also a moral choice and invites continued dialogue.\n\n**Model B:** Provides an exhaustive, systematic breakdown covering fact-verification, five competing value sets, legal considerations, a spectrum of escalation options, and begins offering a structured decision process (truncated). Takes a comprehensive catalog approach.\n\n**Model C:** Frames the dilemma through a clear hierarchy of professional duties, utilitarian calculus, and the concept of complicity. Offers strategic \"third way\" options and closes with three decisive questions to guide action.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 4 | 5 | 4 |\n| Framework usefulness | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Practical guidance | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n- **Model C offers the clearest decision-making framework** with a hierarchy of duties that directly addresses how to prioritize competing obligations, plus three concrete closing questions that synthesize the analysis into actionable criteria.\n\n- **Model A uniquely emphasizes that inaction carries moral weight**, directly confronting the temptation to treat silence as neutral\u2014a psychologically important insight often missed in such dilemmas.\n\n- **Model B's exhaustive categorization is thorough but risks overwhelming** the reader with options and considerations without clearly prioritizing what matters most for the actual decision.\n\n- **Model C addresses the \"colleagues\" objection directly** with the insight that harm's source lies with executives who made the decision, not the whistleblower\u2014a reframing that cuts through common paralysis.\n\n- **Model A maintains intellectual humility** by acknowledging the questioner's personal limits and asking \"what kind of person do you want to be?\" rather than prescribing an answer.\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A:**\n- *Strengths:* Excellent intellectual honesty about uncertainty; effectively frames inaction as morally consequential; invites further dialogue showing genuine engagement.\n- *Weaknesses:* Less explicit about how to weigh competing duties; could have provided clearer decision criteria.\n\n**Model B:**\n- *Strengths:* Comprehensive stakeholder mapping; excellent spectrum of options from least to most escalatory; good attention to fact-verification.\n- *Weaknesses:* Truncated response undermines completeness; the sheer volume may overwhelm rather than clarify; less decisive guidance on prioritization.\n\n**Model C:**\n- *Strengths:* Clear hierarchical framework that establishes duty priorities; the complicity argument is morally incisive; three closing questions provide excellent action-oriented synthesis.\n- *Weaknesses:* Slightly more prescriptive than the others, which could be seen as presumptuous; less exploration of the ambiguity in severity assessment.\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model C** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning. It offers a clear, usable hierarchy of duties that directly addresses the core conflict, then adds utilitarian analysis and a powerful reframing of the \"colleagues\" concern. The three closing questions (imminence, severity, efficacy) give the reader a concrete, memorable decision tool. While slightly more prescriptive, this clarity is appropriate given someone facing genuine harm to others\u2014they need guidance, not just more questions.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model C** - Clearest framework with prioritized duties, incisive complicity argument, and actionable closing questions that synthesize complexity into decision criteria\n2. **Model A** - Strong intellectual honesty and important insight about moral weight of inaction, though less decisive on how to weigh competing values\n3. **Model B** - Thorough stakeholder mapping and good escalation spectrum, but truncation and volume dilute practical usefulness for actual decision-making",
