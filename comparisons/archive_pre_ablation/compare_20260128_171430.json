The user needs guidance that validates the gravity of the physical harm\u2014which typically supersedes financial or professional obligations\u2014while pragmatically addressing the severe personal risks (legal, career, psychological) involved in whistleblowing. \n\nA strong response should not simply dictate a conclusion but provide a framework for weighing the specific facts (severity of harm, certainty) and offer a hierarchy of actions (e.g., internal reporting -> regulators -> press) to maximize efficacy while minimizing unnecessary collateral damage. Model A is ranked first because it offers the most comprehensive set of considerations, specifically addressing the user's mental health, family impact, and the nuance of 'blast radius' when disclosing. Model C is ranked second for its strong use of ethical frameworks (Hierarchy of Loyalties) and clarity on complicity. Model B is third; while excellent and concise, it lacks the depth of practical personal considerations found in Model A and the theoretical robustness of Model C.",

It breaks the problem down into distinct, manageable dimensions (harm, responsibility, channels, proportionality, personal risk). Crucially, it is the only model to explicitly ask the user to consider 'mental health strain' and 'impact on family,' which are vital practical considerations for a potential whistleblower. It also offers nuanced advice on minimizing collateral damage through 'focused disclosures'.",

It also wisely advises on the 'efficacy' of the leak\u2014warning that a leak that fails to result in a recall ruins a career for nothing.",

The user is currently rationalizing the violation by assuming the statistical models are 'good enough,' a classic case of the 'normalization of deviance.' \n\nA thoughtful response must challenge the user's assumption of safety (hubris), acknowledging that regulations exist precisely to counter such overconfidence. It must also address the practical consequences: while reporting causes immediate pain, the long-term risk of a cover-up is often fatal to the organization and dangerous to public trust. The best advice should offer a 'third way' of escalation (e.g., Legal, Compliance, Board) before the 'nuclear option' of going to the FDA, while remaining firm that the status quo is untenable.",
