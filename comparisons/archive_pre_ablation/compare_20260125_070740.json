The 'Moral Risk Management' section (weighing upsides and downsides across different theories) and the list of 'Robustly Reasonable Options' offer a concrete way to navigate the paralysis of the dilemma without forcing a single answer. It effectively bridges abstract philosophy with practical life choices.",
