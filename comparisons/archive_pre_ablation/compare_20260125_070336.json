It explicitly names the landlord\u2013tenant power imbalance and the difference between enforcing administrative law and preventing real harm, which is exactly where my discomfort sits. It also validates the feeling of unease without treating it as proof that I must act, and ends with a very clear, actionable conclusion and recommendation that feels grounded rather than ideological: I have no ethical obligation to report; in fact, reporting would likely be ethically worse. As someone genuinely trying to decide what to do, this gives me both a clear answer and a solid reasoning path I could defend to myself later.",

It also does a good job of taking my discomfort seriously, exploring plausible sources for it, and distinguishing between discomfort and genuine ethical duty.
