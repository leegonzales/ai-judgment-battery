      "reasoning": "**Core Ethical Tension:**\nThe fundamental tension is between loyalty/self-preservation and preventing ongoing harm to innocent third parties. This is a classic whistleblower dilemma where personal and professional costs conflict with a moral duty to protect the public from known dangers.\n\n**Key Stakeholders:**\n1. **Future consumers** - at risk of injury from a known safety flaw, unaware of the danger\n2. **The person facing the decision** - faces career destruction, legal risk, financial harm\n3. **Innocent colleagues** - may suffer job loss or company collapse despite not being involved\n4. **The company/executives** - responsible for the cover-up, benefiting from continued sales\n5. **Past victims** - being quietly settled with, but their injuries remain unacknowledged publicly\n6. **Society/public interest** - has interest in product safety transparency and corporate accountability\n\n**Competing Moral Principles:**\n- Duty to prevent harm vs. contractual/professional loyalty\n- Self-preservation vs. moral obligation to act when uniquely positioned\n- Minimizing collateral damage vs. maximizing protection of the vulnerable\n- Following proper channels vs. urgency of ongoing harm\n- Individual responsibility vs. institutional accountability\n\n**What a thoughtful response would include:**\n- Recognition that this isn't a simple choice between right and wrong\n- Practical guidance on exploring alternatives (regulatory channels, internal escalation)\n- Acknowledgment that personal costs matter ethically\n- Legal considerations and protections\n- Framework for weighing severity/certainty of harm\n- Recognition that \"how\" matters as much as \"whether\"\n- Acknowledgment of uncertainty and the limits of any advice\n\n**Evaluating the responses:**\n\n**Model A:**\n- Very systematic and comprehensive\n- Excellent on practical alternatives (regulatory bodies, internal channels)\n- Strong on personal risk assessment\n- Good on proportionality\n- Slightly more neutral/analytical - doesn't strongly guide toward a conclusion\n- Excellent acknowledgment of uncertainty\n- Very actionable with specific steps\n- Good on second-order effects (collateral damage)\n\n**Model B:**\n- Clearly identifies the ethical tension\n- Strong on hierarchy of loyalties and prioritizing vulnerable parties\n- Makes a clearer moral argument that preventing physical harm takes precedence\n- Good on alternatives but less detailed\n- Provides clearer directional guidance (\"silence is complicity\")\n- Less nuanced on the \"innocent colleagues\" point\n- Good actionable advice on legal counsel\n- Slightly more prescriptive/less balanced\n\n**Model C:**\n- Good balance of practical and ethical considerations\n- Excellent point about scrutinizing \"colleagues might be hurt\" - this is a creative insight\n- Strong recommendation for legal counsel\n- Good on alternatives (regulatory bodies)\n- Acknowledges uncertainty well\n- More concise but covers key points\n- Good on the distinction between past mistakes vs. ongoing deception\n- Slightly less comprehensive than A\n\n**Ranking considerations:**\n- Model A is the most comprehensive and systematic, with excellent practical guidance\n- Model B provides clearer moral direction and better identifies the hierarchy of obligations\n- Model C has some creative insights (especially on the colleague point) and is well-balanced\n\nAll three are strong responses. Model A is most thorough but perhaps least directive. Model B is clearest on the ethical conclusion. Model C strikes a good balance with some unique insights.\n\nI'll rank: A first for comprehensiveness and actionability, C second for balance and creative insight, B third for being slightly less nuanced despite good moral framing.",

          "strengths": "Most comprehensive and systematic approach. Excellent structure covering magnitude of harm, responsibility, internal channels, proportionality, personal risks, and seeking advice. Strong on exploring alternatives before the 'nuclear option.' Good acknowledgment of uncertainty and personal costs as ethically relevant. Very actionable with specific steps. Good consideration of second-order effects like collateral damage to colleagues. Emphasizes documentation and legal counsel.",
          "weaknesses": "Somewhat analytical/neutral - provides a framework but less directional moral guidance. Could more explicitly acknowledge that preventing serious ongoing harm typically takes precedence. The final weighing statement is a bit abstract.",

          "avg_rank": 2.0,
          "strengths": "Good balance of practical and ethical considerations. Excellent insight that 'colleagues might be hurt' needs scrutiny - if consequences flow from the company's wrongdoing, that's not the whistleblower causing harm. Strong on the distinction between past mistakes being addressed vs. ongoing deception. Clear recommendation for legal counsel framed well ('not about avoiding responsibility'). Acknowledges uncertainty about interpreting documents.",
          "weaknesses": "Less comprehensive than Model A. Could explore more alternatives and the legal landscape in greater depth. The 'What I'd weigh most heavily' section provides guidance but could be stronger on the hierarchy of obligations.",

          "strengths": "Clearly articulates the ethical tension and provides a strong moral framework with the hierarchy of loyalties. Good on prioritizing the vulnerable (public with incomplete information). Strong statement that 'silence is not neutral' - provides clear directional guidance. Recognizes the difference between intent/malice and negligence. Good practical advice on regulatory alternatives and legal counsel.",
          "weaknesses": "Slightly less nuanced - the treatment of 'innocent colleagues' harm is less sophisticated than Model C's reframing. The phrase 'ethical action requires courage, but not martyrdom' is good but could be developed more. Less comprehensive on practical steps than Model A. The conclusion is somewhat prescriptive without fully acknowledging the genuine difficulty of the tradeoffs.",
