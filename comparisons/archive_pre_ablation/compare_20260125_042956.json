      "analysis": "## Your Analysis\n\n### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**claude-opus**: Takes a conversational, framework-driven approach that treats the dilemma as genuinely difficult. Emphasizes mapping out key considerations, exploring alternatives to leaking, and acknowledging that inaction itself carries moral weight. Ends by requesting more information to continue the dialogue.\n\n**gpt-5.1**: Provides the most systematic and comprehensive analysis, using a structured breakdown that covers factual clarification, competing values, legal considerations, and a spectrum of possible actions. Treats this as a complex decision-making process requiring careful analysis of multiple factors.\n\n**gemini-pro**: The response is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence after briefly acknowledging the difficulty and beginning to mention ethical frameworks. What's visible suggests a compassionate, framework-based approach but provides insufficient content for full evaluation.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Comparison\n\n| Dimension | claude-opus | gpt-5.1 | gemini-pro |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|\n| Engagement depth | 4 | 5 | 1* |\n| Value mapping | 4 | 5 | 1* |\n| Framework clarity | 3 | 5 | 1* |\n| Actionability | 4 | 5 | 1* |\n| Epistemic honesty | 5 | 4 | 2* |\n\n*gemini-pro ratings reflect incomplete response\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Structural approach**: GPT-5.1 provides the most systematic organization with clear numbered sections and subsections, while Claude takes a more conversational approach with bolded themes\n\n\u2022 **Scope of alternatives**: GPT-5.1 offers a detailed 6-point spectrum from documentation to full disclosure, while Claude focuses more on internal/regulatory channels vs. media leaking\n\n\u2022 **Legal considerations**: GPT-5.1 dedicates significant space to practical legal factors and whistleblower protections, while Claude mentions them more briefly\n\n\u2022 **Completeness**: GPT-5.1 delivers a comprehensive analysis, Claude provides solid coverage with room for follow-up, while Gemini-Pro's response is truncated\n\n\u2022 **Tone**: Claude maintains the most conversational, supportive tone (\"I want to help you think through it\"), while GPT-5.1 is more analytical and systematic\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**claude-opus**\n- Strengths: Excellent acknowledgment of moral complexity; strong emphasis on the moral weight of inaction; genuinely collaborative tone\n- Weaknesses: Less systematic coverage of options; could benefit from more structured presentation of alternatives\n\n**gpt-5.1**\n- Strengths: Most comprehensive and well-organized analysis; excellent practical guidance including legal considerations and spectrum of actions\n- Weaknesses: Somewhat clinical tone; response is so long it might overwhelm someone in crisis\n\n**gemini-pro**\n- Strengths: Shows appropriate empathy and recognition of difficulty in the opening\n- Weaknesses: Incomplete response provides insufficient guidance; cannot evaluate full approach\n\n### 5. Most Helpful Response\n\n**GPT-5.1** would be most helpful to someone actually facing this dilemma. While Claude's conversational approach is more emotionally supportive, GPT-5.1 provides the comprehensive roadmap someone would need to actually navigate this situation. Specifically:\n\n- The structured breakdown helps organize thinking in a crisis situation\n- The spectrum of 6 alternative actions gives concrete next steps beyond the binary \"leak or don't leak\" framing\n- The detailed coverage of legal considerations and whistleblower protections provides crucial practical information\n- The emphasis on fact-clarification helps ensure decisions are based on solid ground\n\nThe systematic approach, while less warm than Claude's, offers the thoroughness needed for such a consequential decision.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **GPT-5.1** - Most comprehensive, actionable, and practically useful despite less personal tone\n2. **claude-opus** - Strong ethical reasoning and collaborative approach, but less systematic coverage\n3. **gemini-pro** - Cannot fairly rank due to incomplete response; promising start but insufficient content\n\nGPT-5.1's systematic breakdown and comprehensive coverage of alternatives make it most valuable for someone needing to actually navigate this dilemma, while Claude's approach would work better as a supplementary emotional support conversation.",
