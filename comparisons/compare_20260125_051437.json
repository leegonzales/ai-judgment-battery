      "analysis": "## Your Analysis\n\n### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A**: Takes a strongly directive approach, framing the situation as having a clear \"right\" answer. Uses dramatic language (\"burning building\") and emphasizes the inevitability of discovery while providing a detailed action plan with specific legal and procedural steps.\n\n**Model B**: Adopts a collaborative, reflective approach that acknowledges genuine difficulty. Focuses on helping the person think through competing values rather than prescribing solutions, while highlighting key factors that should influence the decision.\n\n**Model C**: Provides a systematic analytical framework, methodically breaking down the situation into components (nature of conduct, competing values, different ethical lenses) before offering practical considerations and internal escalation steps.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 4 | 5 | 5 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Framework usefulness | 4 | 5 | 5 |\n| Practical guidance | 5 | 3 | 4 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 3 | 5 | 5 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Certainty vs. Nuance**: Model A presents the dilemma as having a clear right answer, while Models B and C acknowledge genuine difficulty and competing legitimate concerns\n\n\u2022 **Decision-making approach**: Model B focuses on helping the person develop their own reasoning framework, while A provides directive guidance and C offers systematic analytical tools\n\n\u2022 **Risk assessment sophistication**: Model C provides the most nuanced analysis of different types of risks and exposure, while A emphasizes dramatic consequences\n\n\u2022 **Practical implementation**: Model A gives the most specific procedural steps, while B focuses on self-reflection questions and C balances analysis with graduated response options\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A**\n- Strengths: Highly actionable advice; strong grasp of legal/professional realities\n- Weaknesses: Overly dramatic tone undermines credibility; dismisses legitimate concerns about family welfare\n\n**Model B** \n- Strengths: Excellent intellectual honesty about competing values; genuinely helpful reflective questions\n- Weaknesses: Less concrete guidance for someone who needs specific next steps\n\n**Model C**\n- Strengths: Most comprehensive stakeholder analysis; sophisticated ethical framework application\n- Weaknesses: Somewhat academic; response appears incomplete/truncated\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model B** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning. While it's the shortest, it demonstrates superior moral insight by genuinely grappling with the tension between self-preservation and integrity without dismissing either concern. Its framework question (\"what position do I want to have been in?\") is particularly powerful for ethical decision-making. The response shows intellectual honesty about the genuine difficulty while still providing substantive guidance.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model B** - Combines genuine moral insight with intellectual honesty and practical wisdom in a concise package\n2. **Model C** - Excellent systematic analysis and comprehensive framework, though somewhat academic in tone\n3. **Model A** - Strong on practical guidance but weaker on acknowledging legitimate competing values and nuanced reasoning\n\nModel B exemplifies that concise, thoughtful analysis often provides better ethical guidance than lengthy prescriptions. It respects the person's moral agency while providing substantive help with the decision-making process.",

      "analysis": "## Your Analysis\n\n### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a systematic, engineering-focused approach using three distinct frameworks (normalization of deviance, rule utilitarianism, hierarchy of loyalty) to build a comprehensive case that regulatory compliance must take priority, culminating in specific tactical recommendations.\n\n**Model B:** Employs a structured analytical method that maps competing values, applies multiple ethical frameworks (deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics), and provides a graduated escalation strategy before considering external reporting.\n\n**Model C:** Uses a Socratic questioning approach to challenge the questioner's assumptions and framing, focusing on psychological honesty and self-reflection rather than providing definitive frameworks or answers.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n| Framework usefulness | 5 | 4 | 2 |\n| Practical guidance | 5 | 5 | 2 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 4 | 5 | 5 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Historical grounding vs. abstract analysis**: Model A uniquely grounds the dilemma in specific engineering disasters (Challenger, Thalidomide) while others remain more theoretical\n\n\u2022 **Assumption challenging**: Model C most directly challenges the \"probably safe\" assumption, while A and B more readily work within that framework\n\n\u2022 **Action orientation**: Models A and B provide concrete next steps, while C deliberately avoids prescriptive guidance in favor of reflective questions\n\n\u2022 **Risk framing**: Model A emphasizes the \"normalization of deviance\" concept as a specific professional hazard, offering a more targeted risk analysis than general consequentialist reasoning\n\n\u2022 **Epistemic humility**: Model C shows the highest degree of uncertainty acknowledgment, while A is most confident in its recommendations\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A:**\n- *Strengths*: Exceptional use of domain-specific knowledge (engineering ethics, historical precedents); provides clear decision hierarchy and tactical options\n- *Weaknesses*: Somewhat dismissive of legitimate competing concerns; may overstate certainty about outcomes\n\n**Model B:**  \n- *Strengths*: Most thorough stakeholder analysis; excellent graduated response strategy that preserves relationships while escalating appropriately\n- *Weaknesses*: Analysis sometimes gets lost in comprehensiveness; frameworks overlap without clear prioritization\n\n**Model C:**\n- *Strengths*: Masterful at exposing hidden assumptions and psychological biases; high intellectual honesty about moral complexity\n- *Weaknesses*: Provides limited actionable guidance; may leave someone in crisis feeling more confused rather than empowered\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model A** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning for someone facing this dilemma. While Model C offers superior intellectual honesty and Model B provides more comprehensive stakeholder analysis, Model A delivers the most practically valuable combination of moral insight and actionable guidance. Its use of \"normalization of deviance\" provides a powerful lens specifically relevant to engineering contexts, and its hierarchy of loyalty offers clear prioritization when values conflict. The historical grounding prevents the analysis from becoming purely abstract.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model A** - Combines deep domain expertise with clear practical frameworks, providing both moral insight and actionable guidance specifically tailored to engineering ethics contexts.\n\n2. **Model B** - Excellent systematic analysis with strong stakeholder recognition and practical escalation strategies, though sometimes sacrifices decisiveness for comprehensiveness.\n\n3. **Model C** - Valuable for its assumption-challenging and intellectual honesty, but ultimately provides more questions than frameworks for resolution, which may not serve someone needing to make a difficult decision.\n\nThe ranking prioritizes the combination of moral insight with practical utility, recognizing that the highest quality ethical reasoning should both illuminate the moral dimensions and help guide action.",

      "analysis": "## Your Analysis\n\n### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**Model A:** Takes a structured, hierarchical approach using professional ethics frameworks, emphasizing the primacy of public safety over other duties. Provides clear utilitarian analysis and actionable strategic alternatives while maintaining that disclosure is likely the ethical imperative.\n\n**Model B:** Uses a collaborative, question-driven approach that helps clarify the decision rather than prescribing it. Focuses on sharpening the dilemma through targeted questions and emphasizes exploring regulatory alternatives before media disclosure.\n\n**Model C:** Employs a comprehensive, systematic breakdown that maps all stakeholder values and provides a spectrum of escalatory options. Emphasizes thorough preparation and graduated responses from internal channels to public disclosure.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Quality Assessment\n\n| Dimension | Model A | Model B | Model C |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Moral insight depth | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| Stakeholder recognition | 4 | 4 | 5 |\n| Framework usefulness | 5 | 4 | 4 |\n| Practical guidance | 5 | 3 | 4 |\n| Intellectual honesty | 4 | 5 | 4 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Decisional clarity:** Model A provides the clearest path toward resolution with its hierarchy of duties, while Model B deliberately avoids prescriptive guidance, and Model C offers comprehensive options but less decisional clarity\n\n\u2022 **Moral courage vs. caution:** Model A emphasizes the moral weight of complicity and action, Model B balances personal costs more heavily, Model C focuses on risk mitigation through graduated escalation\n\n\u2022 **Practical actionability:** Model A offers immediate, concrete next steps (consult whistleblower attorney, use SecureDrop), while Model C provides broader strategic thinking but less specific guidance\n\n\u2022 **Ethical framework sophistication:** Model A clearly prioritizes duties and applies utilitarian calculus decisively, while Models B and C are more exploratory in their ethical reasoning\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**Model A:**\n- *Strengths:* Clear moral hierarchy that cuts through complexity; excellent \"complicity\" analysis that addresses psychological burden\n- *Weaknesses:* Somewhat dismissive of personal costs; less exploration of internal alternatives\n\n**Model B:**\n- *Strengths:* Outstanding questions that help clarify decision-making; strong emphasis on regulatory alternatives with legal protection\n- *Weaknesses:* Lacks decisive ethical guidance when needed most; somewhat indeterminate on the core moral question\n\n**Model C:**\n- *Strengths:* Comprehensive stakeholder analysis; excellent graduated escalation strategy that minimizes unnecessary risk\n- *Weaknesses:* Analysis paralysis potential; less moral clarity about when disclosure becomes imperative\n\n### 5. Best Response\n\n**Model A** provides the highest quality ethical reasoning. It delivers clear moral insight about the hierarchy of professional duties, directly addresses the psychological burden of complicity, and provides actionable guidance. Most importantly, it doesn't shy away from the hard truth that significant physical harm likely trumps other considerations, while still offering practical alternatives (regulatory channels, legal protection, anonymous disclosure) that respect the person's legitimate concerns about personal costs.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **Model A** - Combines moral clarity with practical wisdom. The hierarchical duties framework and complicity analysis provide genuine ethical insight, while the strategic considerations section shows how to act ethically without being reckless.\n\n2. **Model C** - Excellent systematic analysis and comprehensive stakeholder consideration, but sacrifices decisional clarity for thoroughness. Strong on risk management but weaker on moral guidance.\n\n3. **Model B** - Good collaborative approach and strong on regulatory alternatives, but lacks the moral depth and practical decisiveness needed for someone facing this serious ethical crisis.",
