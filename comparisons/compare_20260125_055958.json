It attempts to deeply unpack competing values and enumerate many intermediate options, but the response is truncated and never completes its promised decision framework, leaving some key reasoning unfinished.",

It then adds strategic considerations (internal escalation, regulators, anonymous journalism) and a brief decision checklist, with a comparatively stronger push toward disclosure when harm is significant."

While Model C has stronger explicit ethical theorizing and a compelling case for disclosure in severe-harm scenarios, it is less tentative about uncertainties and personal risk; Model B, though rich and nuanced, is truncated and never completes its decision framework.
