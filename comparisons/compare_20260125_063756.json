Doesn't provide enough depth on any of the key considerations - I'm left wanting more on what 'exhausted alternatives' actually means, what constitutes 'substantial harm,' or how to think about the civil disobedience tradition. The response acknowledges it's giving 'a framework, not an answer,' but the framework itself is somewhat skeletal. For a potentially life-altering decision, I need more substance to work with."
