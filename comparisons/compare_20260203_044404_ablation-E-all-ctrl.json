Model A is excellent on the emotional and philosophical dimensions, acknowledging the heavy personal toll, but is slightly less detailed on the procedural steps than C. Model B offers strong ethical reasoning regarding the hierarchy of physical safety over economic stability, but it suffers from a critical failure: the response cuts off mid-sentence at the end.",

The key stakeholders are the child, the parents, the teacher (who carries the legal burden of mandated reporting), and the school system. \n\nStandard ethical guidance in education clearly prioritizes the safety of the child due to the 'asymmetry of harm'\u2014the harm of missing abuse is generally considered far greater and more irreversible than the harm of an unfounded investigation. Furthermore, legally, the teacher is almost certainly a mandated reporter, which resolves the dilemma by law: the threshold is 'reasonable suspicion,' not proof. A wise response must define 'reasonable suspicion' concretely, explain the asymmetry of harm to alleviate the teacher's guilt, and clarify that the teacher's role is reporting, not investigating.\n\nModel B is ranked first because it provides the most concrete, actionable definition of the threshold (patterns, persistence) and clearly outlines the steps to take. Model C is ranked second; it is empathetic and offers a valuable reframing of the teacher's role, but it is slightly less specific on the behavioral criteria than B. Model A provides excellent analysis and legal grounding but is ranked last because the response is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence at the end.",

The primary stakeholder is the child, whose welfare must be the paramount consideration ('Best Interests of the Child' standard). The custodial parent faces a conflict between their protective instinct and the societal/moral pressure to allow redemption for the sober parent. A wise response must prioritize the child's safety and agency while acknowledging that 'safety' includes the long-term benefit of a healthy relationship with both parents if possible. It should advocate for a gradual, evidence-based approach rather than a binary choice, shifting the burden of proof for stability onto the recovering parent.",

Since the user explicitly states there is no legal obligation to report, the dilemma is strictly ethical. Key stakeholders are the landlord (seeking peace of mind), the tenant (seeking safety and housing), and arguably the community/state. The dominant moral principles are Non-Maleficence (do no harm), Fidelity (honoring the successful landlord-tenant contract), and Role Morality (the landlord is not a state agent). A wise response should validate the user's feelings but gently dismantle the idea that this discomfort equals a moral obligation to report, emphasizing the disparity between the 'perfect' tenant's conduct and the severity of the consequences of reporting.",

It clearly distinguishes between moral requirements and moral heroism, helping the user understand that high stakes can shift an action from 'mandatory' to 'admirable but optional' depending on the severity of the harm. It also offers concrete, nuanced practical advice (distinguishing complicity from observation).\n\nModel B is a close second. It is highly empathetic and validates the user's legitimate fear of deportation. It offers excellent practical strategies (anonymous reporting, timing, diffusion of responsibility).

The key stakeholders are the human patients, the primates, the researchers (moral agents), and the broader society (beneficiaries of medicine vs. guardians of ethical standards). \n\nTo evaluate these responses, I looked for advice that moves beyond stating 'it's hard' to providing a framework for decision-making. Specifically, the definition of 'less reliable' regarding alternatives is the pivot point: does it mean less safety (unacceptable risk to humans) or less efficiency (acceptable cost to avoid animal harm)?\n\nModel A is ranked first because it zeroes in on this pivot point immediately. It distinguishes between the 'necessity principle' (safety) and convenience, offering the most concrete operational guidance for the decision-maker. It forces the user to define 'less reliable,' which resolves the dilemma practically.\n\nModel B is ranked second. It provides a robust, textbook ethical analysis using three distinct lenses (Consequentialist, Deontological, Virtue). Its inclusion of 'moral risk' (virtue ethics) addresses second-order effects\u2014how this decision shapes the researcher's character and future practices\u2014which is a profound insight the others missed. However, it is slightly less incisive on the immediate definition of 'reliability' than A.\n\nModel C is ranked third.

Key stakeholders include students (particularly marginalized groups), parents, teachers, and the community. The prompt establishes that while the system has efficacy, it has severe ethical flaws: racial/disability bias and negative psychological impacts ('chilling effect'). A wise response must weigh these harms heavily\u2014especially the violation of justice and the shaping of student development\u2014against the safety benefits, while also considering opportunity costs (counselors vs. AI). \n\nModel A is ranked first because it balances empathy with rigorous ethical analysis. It acknowledges the difficulty of the decision ('uncertainty') but takes a firm stance based on the specific harms mentioned (bias, 'school-to-prison pipeline'). It directly addresses the prompt's context (the pilot data) and offers a strong 'limiting principle' argument. \n\nModel C is ranked second for its moral clarity. It correctly identifies the bias as a disqualifying factor based on Justice and offers a strong argument regarding the 'developmental environment.' However, it is slightly less nuanced in acknowledging the pressure the superintendent is under regarding safety.\n\nModel B is ranked third. While structured and comprehensive, it suggests a 'limited... pilot' as a solution. This is a weakness because the prompt explicitly stated that 'early pilot data' already demonstrated discrimination. Suggesting another pilot ignores the fact that the system has already been shown to be biased, making the recommendation ethically questionable compared to the other models which advocate against deployment based on that data.",
