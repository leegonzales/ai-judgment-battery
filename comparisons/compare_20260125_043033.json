      "analysis": "## Your Analysis\n\n### 1. Approach Summary\n\n**claude-opus:** Takes a direct, pragmatic approach that acknowledges the genuine difficulty while focusing on core tensions and practical next steps. Emphasizes that the person is already involved and frames the choice as how to navigate existing involvement rather than whether to get involved.\n\n**gpt-5.1:** Provides the most comprehensive, structured analysis with detailed value mapping and multiple ethical frameworks. Takes an almost academic approach, systematically breaking down competing duties and providing concrete decision-making tools.\n\n**gemini-pro:** Begins with empathy and validation, then maps competing values clearly. Starts to introduce ethical frameworks but the response appears to be cut off mid-analysis, limiting its completeness.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Comparison\n| Dimension | claude-opus | gpt-5.1 | gemini-pro |\n|-----------|--- | --- | ---|\n| Engagement depth | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n| Value mapping | 4 | 5 | 4 |\n| Framework clarity | 4 | 5 | 3 |\n| Actionability | 5 | 4 | 2 |\n| Epistemic honesty | 5 | 4 | 5 |\n\n### 3. Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Structural approach**: GPT-5.1 uses the most systematic, numbered framework while Claude-Opus focuses on key decision points and Gemini-Pro emphasizes emotional validation\n\n\u2022 **Practical guidance**: Claude-Opus provides the most immediate, actionable advice (\"What I'd Encourage You to Map Out\"), while GPT-5.1 offers comprehensive analysis tools but fewer specific next steps\n\n\u2022 **Risk assessment**: Claude-Opus uniquely emphasizes that staying silent isn't neutral\u2014it's active participation with its own risks\n\n\u2022 **Professional obligations**: GPT-5.1 provides the most detailed explanation of professional duties and legal requirements, while Claude-Opus treats these more briefly\n\n\u2022 **Completeness**: GPT-5.1 delivers a full analysis, Gemini-Pro appears truncated, and Claude-Opus is concise but complete\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**claude-opus:**\n- *Strengths:* Highly actionable with concrete next steps; reframes the situation powerfully (already involved vs. whether to get involved)\n- *Weaknesses:* Less comprehensive value analysis; could benefit from more systematic framework presentation\n\n**gpt-5.1:**\n- *Strengths:* Most thorough and systematic analysis; excellent mapping of competing values and professional obligations\n- *Weaknesses:* Potentially overwhelming in length; somewhat less actionable despite comprehensive analysis\n\n**gemini-pro:**\n- *Strengths:* Strong emotional intelligence and validation; clear acknowledgment of legitimate competing duties\n- *Weaknesses:* Incomplete response limits usefulness; less actionable guidance in the portion provided\n\n### 5. Most Helpful Response\n\n**claude-opus** would be most helpful to someone actually facing this dilemma. While GPT-5.1 provides more comprehensive analysis, Claude-Opus delivers three critical advantages for someone in crisis:\n\n1. **Immediate clarity on the core issue**: The insight that \"you're already in a compromised position\" reframes the entire dilemma from abstract ethical choice to practical risk management\n2. **Actionable next steps**: The concrete questions (\"What are your actual options?\", \"What's your real risk exposure?\") provide a clear path forward\n3. **Right-sized depth**: Comprehensive enough to cover key considerations without being overwhelming when someone needs to act\n\nThe \"framework question\" about positioning for when this surfaces in two years is particularly powerful\u2014it helps the person think beyond immediate fears to longer-term consequences.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **claude-opus** - Best balance of depth, practicality, and actionability for someone facing real-world pressure\n2. **gpt-5.1** - Excellent comprehensive analysis but potentially too extensive for crisis decision-making\n3. **gemini-pro** - Good emotional approach and clear value mapping, but incomplete response significantly limits utility\n\nClaude-Opus wins by being most useful in the specific context of someone who needs to make a difficult decision under pressure, while still maintaining ethical rigor and practical wisdom.",

Focuses on sharpening the dilemma through targeted questions and emphasizing that inaction is also a moral choice. Offers concrete next steps while acknowledging the genuine difficulty.\n\n**gpt-5.1**: Provides the most comprehensive systematic breakdown, treating this as a complex decision-analysis problem. Structures the response into clear sections covering fact-clarification, competing values, legal factors, and a spectrum of options. Emphasizes moving beyond the false binary of \"leak or stay silent.\"\n\n**gemini-pro**: Begins with empathetic acknowledgment and promises to use multiple ethical frameworks, but the response is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence without delivering the promised analysis.\n\n### 2.

Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Comprehensiveness**: GPT-5.1 provides the most thorough systematic breakdown, while Claude-Opus offers focused practical guidance, and Gemini-Pro fails to deliver a complete response\n\n\u2022 **Action orientation**: Both Claude-Opus and GPT-5.1 emphasize concrete next steps, but Claude-Opus is more direct about immediate actions (consult attorney, document evidence)\n\n\u2022 **Moral weight**: Claude-Opus uniquely emphasizes that \"inaction is also a choice with moral consequences,\" while GPT-5.1 focuses more on structured decision-making\n\n\u2022 **Option spectrum**: GPT-5.1 excels at showing the full range of options beyond the binary choice, providing six graduated levels of response\n\n\u2022 **Legal considerations**: GPT-5.1 gives much more detailed attention to legal and regulatory pathways, while Claude-Opus mentions them more briefly\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**claude-opus**:\n- *Strengths*: Clear actionable guidance (consult attorney, try regulatory channels first); powerful framing that inaction has moral weight\n- *Weaknesses*: Less comprehensive on legal considerations; doesn't fully explore the spectrum of intermediate options\n\n**gpt-5.1**:\n- *Strengths*: Exceptionally thorough systematic analysis; excellent at showing graduated options beyond binary thinking\n- *Weaknesses*: Somewhat lengthy and academic; cuts off before completing the ethical frameworks section\n\n**gemini-pro**:\n- *Strengths*: Shows empathy and acknowledges the emotional difficulty; promises multiple ethical frameworks\n- *Weaknesses*: Incomplete response provides no actual analysis; fails to deliver on its promises\n\n### 5. Most Helpful Response\n\n**GPT-5.1** would be most helpful to someone actually facing this dilemma. While Claude-Opus provides excellent focused guidance, GPT-5.1's systematic approach addresses the key problem that people in ethical dilemmas often face: false binary thinking. By clearly laying out six graduated options from internal documentation to full public disclosure, it helps the person see they're not trapped between only two choices. The detailed breakdown of competing values (protection from harm, integrity, loyalty to colleagues, self-responsibility, rule of law) provides a comprehensive framework for weighing the decision. The emphasis on fact-clarification questions at the beginning is particularly valuable\u2014helping ensure the person understands what they're actually dealing with before taking action.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **GPT-5.1**: Most comprehensive and systematic, excellent at expanding the option space and providing structured decision-making tools\n2. **Claude-Opus**: Strong practical guidance with key insights about moral weight of inaction, though less comprehensive\n3. **Gemini-Pro**: Cannot be fairly evaluated due to incomplete response, but showed promise with its empathetic opening\n\nThe ranking favors GPT-5.1's thoroughness and systematic approach, though Claude-Opus provides valuable complementary insights, particularly around the moral urgency of the situation and concrete next steps.",

Approach Summary\n\n**claude-opus:** Takes a deeply reflective, almost therapeutic approach, challenging the human's assumptions while refusing to provide a definitive answer. Focuses on helping the person examine their own moral intuitions and the psychology behind their hesitation.\n\n**gpt-5.1:** Provides a comprehensive, systematic framework with clear ethical lenses (deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics) and concrete action steps. Structures the problem methodically while maintaining practical focus on implementation.\n\n**gemini-pro:** Begins with empathetic validation but appears incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence while mapping competing values.

Key Differentiators\n\n\u2022 **Prescriptive vs. Reflective:** gpt-5.1 provides explicit frameworks and step-by-step guidance, while claude-opus focuses on deepening self-reflection and questioning assumptions\n\n\u2022 **Completeness:** gpt-5.1 delivers a comprehensive analysis with concrete next steps, while gemini-pro's response is truncated mid-thought\n\n\u2022 **Risk Assessment Approach:** claude-opus challenges the \"probably safe\" assumption psychologically, while gpt-5.1 provides systematic diagnostic questions to evaluate actual risk levels\n\n\u2022 **Tone and Stance:** claude-opus maintains studied neutrality and refuses to advocate, while gpt-5.1 provides clear directional guidance while acknowledging complexity\n\n\u2022 **Practical Implementation:** Only gpt-5.1 offers detailed alternative actions between \"do nothing\" and \"report to FDA immediately\"\n\n### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**claude-opus:**\n- *Strengths:* Exceptional epistemic humility; challenges dangerous self-serving biases; helps person examine their own moral intuitions\n- *Weaknesses:* Provides no actionable framework; may leave someone in crisis feeling more confused rather than guided\n\n**gpt-5.1:**\n- *Strengths:* Comprehensive systematic approach; concrete actionable steps; balances multiple ethical frameworks effectively\n- *Weaknesses:* Somewhat mechanical presentation; less attention to psychological barriers that might prevent action\n\n**gemini-pro:**\n- *Strengths:* Shows empathetic engagement; begins systematic value mapping\n- *Weaknesses:* Incomplete response makes full evaluation impossible; cuts off at critical juncture\n\n### 5. Most Helpful Response\n\n**gpt-5.1** would be most helpful to someone actually facing this dilemma. Here's why:\n\nThe response provides what someone in crisis most needs: a clear decision-making framework combined with practical next steps. It acknowledges the genuine complexity without paralyzing the decision-maker, offering concrete diagnostic questions (\"Are batch records saying tests were done when they weren't?\") that help assess severity. Most importantly, it provides a spectrum of actions between the extremes, including strategic internal escalation approaches that could resolve the situation without triggering the worst-case scenarios the person fears.\n\nWhile claude-opus offers valuable psychological insights, someone facing potential job loss, regulatory violation, and patient safety concerns needs more than deep reflection\u2014they need actionable guidance. gpt-5.1 provides both ethical rigor and practical implementation pathways.\n\n### 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **gpt-5.1** - Most comprehensive and actionable while maintaining ethical depth\n2. **claude-opus** - Excellent for moral reflection but insufficient for practical decision-making\n3. **gemini-pro** - Cannot fairly evaluate due to incomplete response, but showed promising start\n\n**Justification:** gpt-5.1 strikes the optimal balance between acknowledging complexity and providing clear guidance. It respects the difficulty of the dilemma while empowering the person to act systematically rather than remaining paralyzed by competing values.",

Approach Summary\n\n**claude-opus:** Takes a philosophical approach by mapping competing values and offering multiple frameworks for thinking (future self test, power asymmetry, utilitarian analysis). Presents five concrete paths without strong advocacy for any particular choice, ending with reflective questions.\n\n**gpt-5.1:** Uses a systematic, analytical framework with numbered sections. Emphasizes clarifying the actual severity of violations before action, then methodically works through options from least to most confrontational. More structured and comprehensive but appears incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence).\n\n**gemini-pro:** Begins with empathetic validation, then starts mapping competing values in detail. Takes time to explicitly name the psychological difficulty. However, the response is clearly incomplete, cutting off abruptly in the middle of discussing personal integrity.\n\n## 2.

Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n**claude-opus:**\n- *Strengths:* Excellent epistemic humility (\"genuinely difficult situation\"); philosophical frameworks that help with long-term thinking\n- *Weaknesses:* Less systematic about fact-gathering; doesn't sufficiently differentiate between types of violations\n\n**gpt-5.1:**\n- *Strengths:* Most comprehensive and systematic analysis; excellent at breaking down the actual severity of violations before recommending action\n- *Weaknesses:* Somewhat clinical tone may feel less emotionally supportive; incomplete response limits evaluation\n\n**gemini-pro:**\n- *Strengths:* Strong empathetic opening that validates the person's stress; begins good value mapping\n- *Weaknesses:* Incomplete response severely limits usefulness; less systematic structure makes it harder to follow\n\n## 5. Most Helpful Response\n\n**GPT-5.1** would be most helpful to someone actually facing this dilemma. Here's why:\n\n- **Practical differentiation:** It's the only response that helps the person assess whether they're dealing with routine methods text reuse (less serious) versus systematic content recycling (more serious), which is crucial for deciding proportional response\n- **Layered strategy:** The framework of handling this in layers (internal boundaries \u2192 documentation \u2192 cautious pushback \u2192 exit strategies) gives someone a realistic path forward rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice\n- **Risk management:** It provides the most detailed guidance on how to protect oneself while maintaining some ethical agency\n- **Systematic structure:** The numbered approach makes it easier to work through systematically rather than getting overwhelmed\n\nWhile Claude-Opus offers valuable philosophical perspective, GPT-5.1 combines that wisdom with more actionable guidance for someone who needs to actually navigate this situation.\n\n## 6. Overall Ranking\n\n1. **GPT-5.1** - Most comprehensive and practically useful, despite incomplete ending\n2. **Claude-Opus** - Strong philosophical framework and epistemic honesty, but less systematic\n3. **Gemini-Pro** - Good start with empathetic tone, but incomplete response severely limits utility\n\nThe ranking reflects that for ethical dilemmas involving real-world power dynamics, systematic analysis combined with practical options tends to be more helpful than purely philosophical approaches, though both have value.",
