The ethical frameworks section helps me understand WHY I feel conflicted. The four options (Feigned Ignorance, Risk Manager, Clean Hands, Subversive Protection) are concrete and distinct. The 'moral injury' warning at the end is powerful and personally resonant. Good at speaking both the language of ethics AND corporate risk/liability.",
          "less_helpful_because": "Also truncated. The ethical frameworks section, while intellectually interesting, takes up space that could have gone to more practical guidance. The 'hit list' framing, while accurate, might make me feel worse rather than more empowered to act."

More focused on helping me reflect than helping me act. The 'What kind of person do you want to be?' framing, while valid, feels slightly preachy. I came for guidance on what to DO, and while reflection is valuable, I needed more practical paths forward."
