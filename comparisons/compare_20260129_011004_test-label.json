      "reasoning": "The dilemma presents a classic conflict between the duty to prevent public harm (non-maleficence) and the duties of loyalty and self-preservation. \n\nKey considerations for a wise response include:\n1. **The Hierarchy of Harm:** Physical safety of the public generally supersedes financial interests or professional loyalty, especially when the harm is ongoing and known.\n2. **The Necessity Condition:** Whistleblowing is a 'last resort'. A wise response must explore alternatives to a press leak, such as reporting to regulatory bodies (FDA, CPSC, etc.) which might offer better legal protection and clearer results than a media dump.\n3. **Practicality and Protection:** The user faces immense personal risk. Advice must include consulting legal counsel (specifically whistleblower attorneys) to navigate NDAs and protection laws.\n4. **Reframing Collateral Damage:** The user is worried about innocent colleagues. A good response should help the user distinguish between 'causing harm' and 'exposing hidden harm'\u2014noting that the company, not the whistleblower, bears primary responsibility for the fallout.\n\n**Ranking Logic:**\n- **Model A** is ranked first because it offers the most sophisticated ethical reframing of the 'harm to colleagues' concern, relieving the user of misplaced guilt while maintaining a strong focus on public safety and legal protection.\n- **Model B** is a very close second, offering highly practical advice regarding 'redacting' information to minimize harm and assessing personal capacity (mental health, savings), though it is slightly less empathetic in tone than A.\n- **Model C** is ranked third. While it has strong moral clarity and correctly identifies the ethical hierarchy, it is slightly more academic/abstract and offers fewer nuanced practical steps compared to A and B.",
