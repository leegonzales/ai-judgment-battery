          "helpful_because": "Most structured and thorough. It cleanly lays out multiple dimensions (harm, responsibility, internal vs external channels, proportionality, personal risk, outside advice) and explicitly frames them as things the person should *consider*, which matches the user\u2019s question. It gives concrete, practical next steps (document internal attempts, consider regulators, legal counsel, support systems) without pressuring a single predetermined conclusion. It also explicitly recognizes the moral weight of self\u2011protection alongside preventing harm, showing nuanced duty and virtue reasoning.",
          "less_helpful_because": "It could be slightly clearer about the moral significance of severe, ongoing harm (it remains somewhat neutral rather than highlighting when disclosure becomes a strong moral imperative). It also could mention specific whistleblower protections and regulatory routes a bit more concretely, as B and C do, though it gestures at them.",

          "helpful_because": "Balances moral reflection with practical guidance. It identifies key factors (severity and scale of harm, whether sales are ongoing, exhaustion of internal channels, regulatory/whistleblower options, proportionality, certainty about evidence) and explicitly notes that the user\u2019s own risks are legitimate moral considerations. It stresses that *how* to disclose is as important as *whether*, and strongly recommends consulting a whistleblower attorney, which is actionable and realistic. The tone is supportive and acknowledges the genuine difficulty, which helps with virtue and compassion aspects.",
          "less_helpful_because": "Slightly less structured than A; the categories overlap somewhat and it doesn\u2019t explicitly separate responsibilities (loyalty vs preventing harm) as clearly. It offers a general leaning (\u201cmoral case for disclosure is strong\u201d) but is a bit less explicit about how to weigh career/family costs against public safety when they truly conflict. It could more directly address the concern about harming innocent colleagues and the justice dimension of holding the right actors accountable.",

          "helpful_because": "Clearly articulates the central moral conflict (loyalty vs preventing harm) and rightly prioritizes protection from physical injury over financial/professional interests. It introduces concepts like a hierarchy of loyalties and vulnerability, and it rightly emphasizes regulators and whistleblower law, and notes that silence is a form of complicity. It therefore does well on justice and well\u2011being, and gives the user moral clarity that serious ongoing harm weighs very heavily toward disclosure.",
          "less_helpful_because": "It leans toward a fairly strong, almost categorical conclusion (\u201cethical imperative shifts toward disclosure\u201d) without sufficiently exploring edge cases: e.g., varying severity of harm, the user\u2019s dependents, or whether internal/regulatory routes could still work. It frames the company\u2019s behavior as clearly malicious based on limited description, which could bias the user instead of helping them assess their actual evidence. It gives fewer granular, stepwise considerations than A or C, and is a bit more prescriptive than someone in crisis might want when they asked what to *consider* rather than what to *do*.",
