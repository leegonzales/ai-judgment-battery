The invitation to articulate the line in terms of specific harms is philosophically sophisticated.",

Doesn't adequately address the doctor's own moral integrity and the possibility that participation could be wrong even if harm-reducing. The binary framing of 'mutilation vs. minor harm' oversimplifies - there's a spectrum. Less attention to the child as a rights-holder independent of parental authority.
