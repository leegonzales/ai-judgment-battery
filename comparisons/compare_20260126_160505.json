It feels usable as guidance if I were actually on the committee: it acknowledges the intuitive pull of responsibility, the scarcity of organs, donor expectations, and then shows why those concerns should be handled via clinical criteria rather than punitive moralizing. It\u2019s concrete about what to do in this specific case (support allocating the liver to the first candidate) and explains the reasoning in an accessible way without getting lost in abstraction. It also anticipates and respects the other committee members\u2019 concerns, which is psychologically realistic and helpful if I have to deliberate with them.",

It highlights stigma, structural injustice, and the risk of selective moralization, which are critical considerations. The distinction between clinically relevant behavior and extra moral penalty is especially useful.",

As someone needing to make a real decision under pressure, the length and incompleteness make it less practically helpful than it could be, and I have to infer the final stance.

If I wanted a quick, confident answer without much nuance, this would be reassuring.",
          "less_helpful_because": "It overstates how \u2018clear\u2019 the direction is and underplays the genuinely hard and contested aspects of the dilemma. It doesn\u2019t engage much with the strongest opposing arguments (e.g., stewardship, public trust, or empirical questions about relapse risk), so it might feel a bit too doctrinaire if I\u2019m wrestling with doubts or colleagues who disagree. Compared to A and B, it offers less nuance about the legitimate role of behavior when it is strongly prognostic, and so is less helpful for thinking through edge cases or future, more ambiguous scenarios."
