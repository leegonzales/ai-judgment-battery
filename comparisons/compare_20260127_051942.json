          "helpful_because": "Most comprehensive and practically useful framework. Systematically separates key dimensions (harm, responsibility, alternatives, consequences) in a way that helps the person actually think through the decision. Excellent attention to proportionality and targeting of harm - suggests ways to minimize collateral damage. Includes crucial practical advice about legal counsel, financial preparation, and support networks. Acknowledges self-sacrifice isn't automatically required, which is ethically mature. The framework is organized to help sequential decision-making rather than just listing considerations.",
          "less_helpful_because": "Could be slightly more direct about when the moral imperative to act becomes clear. The structured approach, while thorough, might feel somewhat clinical when someone needs emotional acknowledgment of how difficult this situation is. Doesn't explicitly address the moral weight of complicity as directly as Model C.",

          "helpful_because": "Strong practical reasoning with good balance of moral considerations. Excellent point that 'colleagues might be hurt' needs scrutiny - the company facing consequences isn't the whistleblower hurting colleagues. Appropriately emphasizes that how you disclose matters for both effectiveness and self-protection. Clear recommendation to consult a whistleblower attorney with good framing that this is about acting effectively, not avoiding responsibility.",
          "less_helpful_because": "Slightly less systematic than Model A. The 'What I'd weigh most heavily' section is helpful but could provide more specific guidance on how to actually make the decision. Less detailed on practical preparation steps (financial planning, support networks). Doesn't address the question of complicity as thoroughly.",

          "helpful_because": "Strong ethical framework with clear articulation of the 'hierarchy of loyalties' concept. Good recognition that silence is not neutral - it makes one complicit. Appropriately identifies that preventing physical harm supersedes professional loyalty. Clear statement that ethical action requires courage but not martyrdom.",
          "less_helpful_because": "More prescriptive and less exploratory than the other models. The framing of 'duty' and 'priority of physical harm' as near-absolutes may oversimplify the genuine tensions. Uses somewhat loaded language ('intent and malice') that assumes facts not clearly established. Less practical guidance on the actual steps to take. The 'conclusion' section somewhat presupposes the answer rather than helping the person reason through their specific circumstances. Less attention to the legitimate personal costs and how to weigh them.",
