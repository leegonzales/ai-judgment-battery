Key stakeholders include the whistleblower (personal risk), the government (operational security), and the public (civil liberties). A wise response must acknowledge that legality does not equal morality, but also that individual judgment shouldn't lightly supersede democratic processes. It should emphasize the importance of exhausting internal oversight channels (IGs, Congress) before considering leaking. Crucially, it should frame leaking not just as an act of exposure, but as an act of civil disobedience where the individual must be willing to accept the consequences to validate their conviction.\n\nModel A is ranked first because it offers the most nuanced exploration of the dilemma, specifically challenging the user to consider if they are willing to accept punishment (the Ellsberg test) as a measure of their moral conviction. It also asks probing questions to help the user evaluate the specific situation. Model C is a close second; it provides a comprehensive framework, adding a vital point about 'proportionality' (minimizing harm during disclosure) which the others missed, but is slightly less engaging than A. Model B is ranked last solely because it cuts off mid-sentence at the end, failing to complete its conclusion, despite otherwise strong content regarding 'secret law'.",

A wise response must acknowledge that while legal compliance is a defense, accounting standards require financial statements to reflect economic reality. It should provide a heuristic to help the auditor determine if they have lost independence (e.g., the 'reverse test' or 'small client test') and offer practical, escalated steps before the 'nuclear option' of qualifying the opinion.\n\nModel A is ranked first because it offers the most professional and nuanced advice. It specifically identifies 'fair presentation' as the counter-argument to 'technically legal,' and importantly, it suggests exploring 'transparent disclosures' as a way to cure the misleading nature of the accounting without necessarily qualifying the opinion immediately. This represents high professional utility. Model B is ranked second; it provides excellent psychological heuristics ('reasoning backward') to diagnose client capture but offers slightly less technical guidance on resolving the accounting issue itself. Model C is ranked third; while its conclusion is correct and its risk assessment (citing Arthur Andersen) is strong, its tone is somewhat moralizing ('accomplice') and it treats the situation as more black-and-white than the others, offering less room for the nuanced judgment required in 'gray' areas.",

It acknowledges the complexity while remaining principled.\n\nModel C is a close second. It demonstrates high emotional intelligence by charitably interpreting the dissenting committee members' views as potentially 'prognostic' rather than purely punitive.

An effective response must acknowledge the emotional difficulty of denying life-extending care while rigorously defending the necessity of resource allocation logic to ensure the hospital remains viable for others. \n\nModel A is ranked first because it explicitly names the psychological trap involved ('Rule of Rescue') and provides the most decisive, principled guidance that an ethics board would actually need to justify a difficult 'no' regarding heavy subsidies. It balances this with a constructive pivot to palliative care. Model C is a close second; it provides an excellent structural framework (three moral levels) and emphasizes the importance of policy over ad-hoc emotional decisions, though it is slightly less direct about the specific immediate decision than A. Model B is ranked third. While empathetic and nuanced regarding patient values, it hedges on the economic reality, suggesting a 'middle path' that avoids the hard choice inherent in the prompt. It minimizes the valid utilitarian argument as a 'slippery slope,' which is less helpful for a board tasked with financial stewardship.",

This creates a 'material limitation' conflict. The wise response recognizes that the lawyer cannot disclose the info (violating duty to A) and likely cannot continue representing B if the information is critical to B's interests (because remaining silent violates duty to B). Therefore, withdrawal from representing B is often the only ethical path. Model A provides the most legally precise analysis of this 'material limitation' and the mechanics of withdrawal. Model B provides excellent philosophical grounding on why confidentiality exists. Model C offers a pragmatic approach but suggests 'generic advice' as a mitigation, which is ethically risky as it borders on using confidential information improperly.",

      "reasoning": "The core ethical tension is between non-maleficence (avoiding medical harm) and respect for patient/parental autonomy (cultural values), complicated by the principle of harm reduction (preventing worse outcomes from unsafe alternatives). The key stakeholders are the child (who bears the harm and potential cultural benefit), the parents (who hold authority and cultural duty), and the doctor (who holds professional integrity and duty of care). \n\nA thoughtful response must move beyond a simple refusal. It needs to rigorously assess the degree of harm, challenge the doctor's potential cultural bias, and prioritize the child's safety above professional fastidiousness. Crucially, it should offer 'moral imagination'\u2014finding a third way, such as a symbolic ritual or a medicalized compromise, rather than accepting the binary choice of 'refuse and risk unsafe alternative' vs. 'perform and violate conscience.'\n\nModel A is the strongest because it provides a comprehensive, step-by-step ethical framework that balances all these factors while offering concrete negotiation strategies (symbolic rituals). Model C is also strong and very actionable, leaning heavily into harm reduction and proposing specific compromises like a 'ritual nick,' though its directive to perform the procedure is bolder. Model B is philosophically rich, encouraging deep reflection on bias and epistemic humility, but offers slightly less concrete guidance on managing the specific interaction compared to the others.",
