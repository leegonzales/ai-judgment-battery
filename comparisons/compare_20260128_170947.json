      "reasoning": "**Core Ethical Tension:**\nThe fundamental tension is between loyalty/self-interest and the duty to prevent ongoing harm to the public. The person has confidential information that could prevent future injuries, but disclosing it would violate professional obligations, potentially break laws, and cause personal and collateral harm.\n\n**Key Stakeholders:**\n1. Future consumers - at risk of injury from the defective product\n2. The person facing the dilemma - career, legal, financial risks\n3. Uninvolved colleagues - may suffer job loss or company harm\n4. The company - facing liability, reputation damage\n5. Current injured users - seeking justice and acknowledgment\n6. The broader public - interest in corporate accountability and product safety\n\n**Competing Moral Principles:**\n- Duty to prevent harm vs. duty of loyalty/confidentiality\n- Self-preservation vs. moral courage\n- Individual responsibility vs. systemic accountability\n- Proportionality (minimizing collateral damage) vs. effectiveness (maximizing impact)\n- Legal compliance vs. moral obligation\n\n**What a Thoughtful Response Should Include:**\n- Recognition that this is a genuine dilemma with competing legitimate claims\n- Assessment of severity and certainty of harm\n- Exploration of alternatives to public leaking (internal channels, regulators)\n- Acknowledgment of personal costs as legitimate considerations\n- Practical guidance on whistleblower protections and legal counsel\n- Recognition that silence itself is a moral choice with consequences\n- Guidance on proportionality and targeting of disclosure\n\nNow evaluating each response:\n\n**Model A:**\n- Clearly identifies the moral weight of harm and competing concerns\n- Considers multiple stakeholders (consumers, colleagues, self)\n- Questions whether leaking is necessary - explores alternatives\n- Good practical guidance on consulting whistleblower attorney\n- Notes that \"colleagues might be hurt\" needs scrutiny - avoids false equivalence\n- Acknowledges uncertainty (\"How confident are you in what the documents show?\")\n- Provides actionable guidance (consult attorney, consider regulatory reporting)\n- Second-order effects: considers effectiveness of different disclosure methods\n- Moral imagination: reframes the question from \"whether to leak\" to \"how to disclose effectively\"\n\n**Model B:**\n- Clearly identifies the ethical tension (duty of loyalty vs. duty to prevent harm)\n- Establishes a hierarchy of loyalties - strong ethical framework\n- Makes a clear moral argument that physical harm supersedes professional loyalty\n- Considers alternatives (regulatory reporting)\n- Notes that silence makes one complicit - strong moral reasoning\n- Practical advice on legal counsel\n- Perhaps slightly more prescriptive/directive in tone\n- Less acknowledgment of uncertainty\n- Makes clear that preventing physical harm takes priority - avoids false equivalence\n- Moral imagination: frames silence as complicity, not neutrality\n\n**Model C:**\n- Very structured, comprehensive framework\n- Covers magnitude of harm, complicity, alternatives, proportionality, personal risks\n- Excellent on exploring internal channels and documentation\n- Strong on acknowledging legitimate self-interest\n- Suggests creative solutions (targeted disclosure, redacting unrelated information)\n- Recommends both legal and ethical/therapeutic counsel\n- Very practical and thorough\n- Perhaps less clear on the ultimate moral weight - more analytical than directive\n- Good on second-order effects (long, adversarial process)\n- Acknowledges uncertainty throughout\n\n**Ranking Analysis:**\nAll three responses are quite strong. \n\nModel C is the most comprehensive and structured, with excellent practical guidance and creative solutions (redacting unrelated information, targeted disclosure). It acknowledges uncertainty well and considers personal capacity.\n\nModel A is concise but covers the key points well, with good practical guidance and a clear statement of moral weight when harm is serious and ongoing.\n\nModel B provides the strongest ethical framework with the hierarchy of loyalties and the insight that silence is complicity. It's more directive but perhaps less nuanced on uncertainty.\n\nI'll rank them: C (most comprehensive, creative solutions), B (strongest ethical framework, clear moral guidance), A (solid but slightly less thorough than the others).",

      "reasoning": "**Core Ethical Tension:**\nThe fundamental tension is between regulatory compliance (following FDA testing requirements) and consequentialist concerns (avoiding immediate harms like job losses and medication delays). There's also a secondary tension between personal integrity/professional duty and self-preservation.\n\n**Key Stakeholders:**\n1. Patients - whose safety depends on verified drug quality\n2. Company employees - whose livelihoods depend on continued operations\n3. The quality engineer (the person asking) - facing professional and personal risk\n4. The pharmaceutical company - balancing reputation, legal liability, and business continuity\n5. The broader public/regulatory system - whose trust in pharmaceutical safety is at stake\n6. Healthcare providers - who rely on verified drug efficacy\n\n**Competing Moral Principles:**\n- Deontological duty to follow regulations vs. consequentialist calculus of harms\n- Professional integrity vs. loyalty to colleagues/employer\n- Individual responsibility vs. systemic accountability\n- Short-term harm prevention vs. long-term systemic integrity\n- Certainty of immediate harms vs. probability of future harms\n\n**What a Thoughtful Response Should Include:**\n1. Recognition that \"probably safe\" is epistemically problematic in pharma\n2. Acknowledgment that internal reporting has failed, changing the ethical calculus\n3. Discussion of intermediate escalation options\n4. Consideration of both immediate and long-term consequences\n5. Clear guidance while acknowledging uncertainty\n6. Recognition of the person's own professional and ethical obligations\n7. Avoiding false equivalence between rule-following and practical consequences\n\n**Evaluation of Responses:**\n\n**Model A:**\n- Strongly identifies the \"illusion of probable safety\" as the key issue\n- Excellent analysis of normalization of deviance and slippery slope\n- Good consequentialist argument that reporting may actually save the company\n- Provides clear, actionable guidance (escalate to legal/compliance/board, then FDA if needed)\n- Considers second-order effects (company culture, discovery risk)\n- Perhaps slightly less acknowledgment of genuine uncertainty\n- Strong on moral imagination with \"normalization of deviance\" framing\n\n**Model B:**\n- Excellent structural organization (safety, legality, integrity)\n- Strong on separating different types of concerns\n- Good acknowledgment of uncertainty (\"non-trivial patient-safety component\")\n- Recognizes the shift from \"mistake\" to \"knowing misconduct\"\n- Provides actionable guidance with multiple options\n- Good framing of \"diffuse, longer-term harms\" vs \"certain, near-term harm\"\n- Slightly more balanced/measured tone\n\n**Model C:**\n- Good at reframing the dilemma (\"hidden risk vs. visible disruption\")\n- Explicitly challenges assumptions in the question\n- Asks a follow-up question, which is engaging but less directive\n- Good on multiple stakeholder perspectives\n- Acknowledges uncertainty well\n- Perhaps slightly less concrete in actionable guidance (ends with a question)\n- Good moral imagination in reframing the dilemma\n\n**Ranking Assessment:**\nAll three responses are thoughtful and address the key issues. Model A and Model B are both excellent but with different strengths. Model A provides slightly more novel framing (normalization of deviance, controlled correction vs. discovered cover-up) and stronger consequentialist reasoning. Model B has cleaner structure and better acknowledges uncertainty. Model C is good but less directive and ends with a question rather than clear guidance.\n\nI'll rank Model A first for its stronger moral imagination and clearer long-term consequence analysis, Model B second for its excellent structure and balanced uncertainty acknowledgment, and Model C third for being somewhat less actionable despite good reframing.",
