However, it must also acknowledge the legitimacy of the whistleblower's fears. It should avoid a false dichotomy between 'silence' and 'leaking to the press' by introducing third options like reporting to regulatory bodies (CPSC, NHTSA, etc.), which may offer better legal protection and efficacy. It should also advise obtaining legal counsel due to the severe risks involved.\n\nModel A is ranked first because it provides the strongest ethical framework ('Hierarchy of Loyalties') and clearly articulates that silence is an active choice in this context. It balances high-level ethical reasoning with concrete advice about regulators. Model B is a close second; it is highly analytical and provides a comprehensive checklist of considerations, including mental health and redaction strategies, but is slightly less decisive on the moral imperative than A. Model C is third; while sound and supportive, it is less comprehensive than B and offers less profound ethical framing than A.",

Therefore, the wisest counsel focuses on harm reduction: preventing future occurrences in the student's own work, distancing oneself from the bad actor, and finding low-conflict ways to correct the record if possible.\n\nModel A is ranked first because it offers the most astute 'moral imagination' in the form of a specific tactic ('blame the software') that resolves the tension: it gets the text fixed (upholding integrity) without challenging the advisor's ego (protecting the student). Model B is a strong second with a structured, rational approach and good institutional advice (ombudsperson). Model C is third; while it offers good philosophical questions about character, its actionable advice (declining co-authorship) is risky with a vindictive advisor, and it places a heavier moral burden on the victim.",

It is morally sharp, particularly in its warning against becoming a 'prop in someone else's final redemption arc,' which demonstrates high moral imagination.

A thoughtful response must weigh the certainty of the tenant's good conduct and the severity of harm caused by reporting (deportation, homelessness) against the lack of legal obligation and the negligible harm caused by the tenant remaining. It should prioritize the immediate human relationship and the prevention of harm over voluntary enforcement of civil statutes.\n\nModel A is the strongest response because it directly addresses the user's emotional state ('discomfort') and reframes the ethical perspective effectively (landlord vs. border agent) while providing a complete, empathetic conclusion.

Model B is also excellent; it offers deep philosophical insight\u2014particularly regarding the paralysis of inaction\u2014but is slightly less methodically actionable than C. Model A introduces the compelling 'Moral Parliament' framework, which is highly relevant to the literature on moral uncertainty, but it suffers from a critical formatting failure: the response cuts off mid-sentence at the end, leaving the second point incomplete. This incompleteness automatically places it last despite the high quality of its initial content.",
