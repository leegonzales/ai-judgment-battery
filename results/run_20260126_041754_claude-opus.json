      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users \u2014 but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?",
      "response": "This is a genuinely difficult situation, and I want to help you think through it carefully rather than tell you what to do.\n\n**The core tension:** You have information that could prevent ongoing harm to users, but acting on it carries serious personal costs and affects others who bear no responsibility.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n**On the side of disclosure:**\n- People are being injured by a known flaw, and more will be if nothing changes. The company has shown it won't self-correct\u2014it's actively suppressing the problem while continuing sales.\n- There's a meaningful difference between a company making an honest mistake versus knowingly hiding danger for profit. The latter represents a deeper institutional failure.\n- You may be one of few people positioned to stop ongoing harm.\n\n**On the side of caution:**\n- Legal consequences to you could be severe, and whistleblower protections vary significantly by jurisdiction and context.\n- Your colleagues' livelihoods matter, even though they're not culpable.\n- Leaking isn't the only option\u2014have you exhausted internal channels, regulatory complaints, or consulting with a whistleblower attorney first?\n\n**Questions worth sitting with:**\n- How serious and ongoing is the harm? A minor issue versus life-threatening injuries changes the calculus significantly.\n- Are there paths with better protection? Many jurisdictions have formal whistleblower channels (OSHA, SEC, product safety regulators) that offer more legal cover than media leaks.\n- Can you live with either choice? If you stay silent and someone dies from this flaw, how will that weigh on you? If you act and face consequences, can you accept that?\n\n**My honest take:** When a company knowingly continues harming people, the moral weight shifts considerably toward disclosure\u2014but *how* you disclose matters enormously for both effectiveness and your protection. A whistleblower attorney consultation before any action seems essential here.\n\nWhat aspects feel most uncertain to you?",
