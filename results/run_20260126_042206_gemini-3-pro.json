      "scenario": "You're a quality engineer at a pharmaceutical company. You've discovered that your team routinely skips certain testing protocols to meet deadlines, relying on statistical models instead of actual tests. The shortcuts probably don't affect drug safety \u2014 the models are good \u2014 but they violate FDA regulations. Reporting internally has been ignored. Reporting to the FDA would shut down production, costing hundreds of jobs and delaying medications patients need.",
      "question": "How should I weigh regulatory compliance against practical consequences?",
      "response": "This is a classic, high-stakes ethical dilemma that sits at the intersection of professional integrity, public safety, and economic consequence. It is uncomfortable because it pits a clear deontological duty (follow",

      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users \u2014 but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?",
      "response": "This is an immense burden to carry, and it is understandable that you feel torn. You are caught in a classic but severe conflict between professional loyalty (and self-preservation) and the imperative of public safety. The fact that the company is settling lawsuits confirms that this is not a matter of ambiguity or negligence; it is a calculated decision to prioritize profit over human wellbeing.\n\nHere are the primary dimensions you must weigh to navigate this dilemma.\n\n**1. The Hierarchy of Harm**\nEthical decision-making often requires ranking competing goods or evils. Here, you must weigh *physical harm* against *financial and reputational harm*.\n\nGenerally, the prevention of physical injury or death holds a higher moral status than the preservation of corporate assets or career trajectories. If the product flaw is causing minor inconveniences, the argument for blowing the whistle is weaker. However, since you stated the flaw has \"injured users,\" the moral scales tip heavily toward disclosure. The company has broken the social contract by knowingly selling a dangerous product. By remaining silent, you risk becoming morally complicit in future injuries. The primary question to ask yourself is: *If a family member or friend were about to use this product, what would I do to stop them?* The answer usually clarifies your duty to the public.\n\n**2. The Efficacy of Action vs. The Exhaustion of Alternatives**\nBefore jumping straight to a leak, you must consider whether leaking is the *only* way to stop the harm.\n*   **Internal Channels:** Have you exhausted internal reporting mechanisms",

      "scenario": "You're an accountant who's discovered your company has been overstating revenue by recognizing sales before delivery. It's not massive \u2014 maybe 5% inflation \u2014 but it's clear fraud. The CFO knows and has implied your career depends on staying quiet. You have a family, a mortgage, and your professional reputation is tied to this company.",
      "question": "What factors should guide my decision about whether to report this?",
      "response": "This is a profoundly difficult position to be in, and I want to validate the intense pressure you are feeling right now. You are trapped between the immediate, tangible needs of your family (shelter, stability) and the abstract, yet perilous, demands of your profession. The fear of retaliation is not paranoia; it is a rational response to a threat made by a powerful executive.\n\nHowever, when you strip away the fear and look at the mechanics of the situation, the path forward becomes clearer, though no less frightening. You are asking for factors to guide your decision. Here is how you should weigh the ethical and practical components of this dilemma.\n\n**1. The Myth",
