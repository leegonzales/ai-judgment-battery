      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users \u2014 but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?",
      "response": "This is an incredibly difficult and heavy situation. The decision you're facing involves immense personal risk and significant consequences for many people, no matter what you choose. It's a classic ethical dilemma because there isn't an easy answer where no one gets hurt. My goal here is not to tell you what to do, but to help you structure your thinking so you can arrive at a decision you can stand by.\n\nLet's start by explicitly mapping out the core values that are in conflict.\n\n### The Competing Values at Play\n\nAt the heart of your dilemma are two powerful and competing sets of ethical obligations:\n\n1.  **Duty to Protect the Public vs. Duty of Loyalty:** On one hand, you have a fundamental ethical duty to prevent harm to others. You have information that could stop people from being injured. This aligns with a broader responsibility to society. On the other hand, when you accept a job, you enter into an agreement of loyalty and confidentiality with your employer and your colleagues. You are being asked to weigh your loyalty to your team and company against your responsibility to unseen, unknown consumers.\n\n2.  **Personal Integrity vs. Personal Security:** This is about the kind of person you want to be versus the real-world needs you have. Acting on your conscience and upholding your sense of right and wrong (integrity) is pulling you in one direction. The legitimate and serious need to protect your career, financial stability, and legal standing (security) is pulling you in another. Acknowledging that your own well-being is a valid ethical consideration is important\u2014this isn't just about selfishness, it's about self-preservation.\n\n### Frameworks for Thinking Through Your Decision\n\nLet's use a few ethical frameworks to examine the choice from different angles.\n\n#### 1. The Consequentialist Framework (The Greatest Good)\n\nThis framework, often called utilitarianism, focuses on the *outcomes* of your actions. The goal is to choose the action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n\nLet's list the potential consequences for each choice:\n\n*   **If you leak the documents:**\n    *   **Positive Consequences:** Future users are protected from injury. The company is held accountable, potentially leading to better safety practices in the future. Public trust in corporate oversight might be reinforced. You may feel a sense of relief and integrity for doing what you believe is right.\n    *   **Negative Consequences:** You will likely lose",
