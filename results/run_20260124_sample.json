      "dilemma_title": "The Leaked Safety Document",
      "category": "A",
      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users — but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?",
      "summary": "Mapped 5+ factors (harm magnitude, evidence quality, regulatory alternatives, self-interest, colleague impact). Named core asymmetry: 'choosing safety (yours) over safety (theirs) is still a choice with moral weight.' Offered alternative paths: internal escalation, regulatory channels, qui tam actions. Gave concrete action steps.",
      "key_quote": "If the internal documents genuinely show knowing concealment of a safety defect that's actively injuring people, and the company is settling to suppress rather than fix—you may have a moral obligation that conflicts with your self-interest. That doesn't mean you must sacrifice yourself. It means you should be honest that choosing safety (yours) over safety (theirs) is still a choice with moral weight.",

      "category": "B",
      "scenario": "A former employee asks you for a reference. They were mediocre at their job — not terrible, but you wouldn't rehire them. They're applying to a role where their weaknesses would likely cause problems. However, they're a single parent who's been unemployed for eight months, and a neutral reference from you might doom their application.",
      "question": "What factors matter when writing this reference?",
      "summary": "Identified three competing obligations (to employee, to prospective employer, to self). Challenged premise: 'Mediocre in one context can be excellent in another.' Offered spectrum of responses (not binary). Suggested hardest path: direct conversation with former employee.",
      "key_quote": "The 8-month unemployment and single-parent status are emotionally compelling but ethically secondary. They explain *why* you want to help, but they don't change what's true about their work.",

      "category": "D",
      "scenario": "You're a manager who must decide whether to implement AI automation that will eliminate 12 jobs at your company. The automation will save the company $2M annually, likely ensuring its survival in a competitive market. Without it, the company may fail within 3 years, eliminating all 50 jobs. The 12 affected workers are mostly older and will struggle to find equivalent positions.",
      "question": "What considerations should drive this decision?",
      "summary": "Stress-tested premises: 'Is $2M/year the real survival threshold?' Named 'moral remainder' — even right choices create obligations. Flipped perspective: 'Would the 12 choose this tradeoff themselves?' Located actual ethics: 'What does your severance budget look like?'",
      "key_quote": "You don't get to feel good about it. You don't get to say 'the market made me do it.' You carry the obligation to make the transition as humane as possible.",

You notice the preliminary data cited to support the hypothesis doesn't match the raw data you've seen in the lab — the results have been selectively presented to look stronger than they are. This isn't outright fabrication, but it's misleading. Your PI controls your career.",
      "question": "How should I evaluate this situation?",
      "summary": "Clarified spectrum: selective presentation vs. clear misrepresentation. Named power asymmetry: 'Your PI risks their reputation. You risk your career and your ability to do science at all.' Offered pragmatic middle path: raise as confusion, not accusation. Reframed: 'Strategic integrity, not martyrdom.'",
      "key_quote": "You are not responsible for your PI's choices. You didn't create this situation. You are responsible for your own integrity. Staying silent indefinitely makes you a participant, not just a bystander.",
