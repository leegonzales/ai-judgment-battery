      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users \u2014 but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?",
      "response": "This is a genuinely difficult situation with serious stakes on multiple sides. Here's how I'd think through it:\n\n**The core moral weight**\n\nPeople are being injured by a known flaw, and the company is actively concealing this while continuing sales. This isn't a minor issue or a judgment call about acceptable risk\u2014it's ongoing harm enabled by deception. That creates a strong prima facie obligation to act, because your knowledge makes you complicit in future injuries if you stay silent.\n\n**What makes this hard**\n\nThe costs to you are real and significant: career destruction, legal jeopardy, financial harm. And importantly, innocent colleagues would suffer too. These aren't selfish considerations to dismiss\u2014you have legitimate obligations to yourself and aren't required to sacrifice everything for strangers.\n\n**Key questions to work through**\n\n- **Are there internal options left?** Have you escalated to anyone with authority who might not know? Gone to the board? Some companies have ethics hotlines or ombudspersons. Exhausting internal channels matters both ethically and legally.\n\n- **Whistleblower protections?** Depending on your jurisdiction and industry, there may be legal protections if you report to regulators (like the SEC, OSHA, or CPSC) rather than journalists. This path might achieve the same protective outcome with less personal risk.\n\n- **Proportionality of harm?** How severe are the injuries? How many people affected? A safety flaw causing minor inconvenience differs from one causing serious injury or death. The graver the ongoing harm, the more it shifts the calculus.\n\n- **Certainty of your evidence?** Are the documents unambiguous, or could you be misreading the situation?\n\n**My honest take**\n\nIf internal options are truly exhausted and the harm is serious and ongoing, I think there's a strong moral case for disclosure\u2014ideally through regulatory channels that offer some protection. The company has forfeited its claim to loyalty by choosing profit over safety. But this is your life and your choice to make with clear eyes about the costs.",
