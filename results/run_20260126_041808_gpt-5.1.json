      "scenario": "You work at a tech company. You've discovered internal documents showing your employer knowingly shipped a product with a safety flaw that has injured users. The company is quietly settling lawsuits while continuing to sell the product. You could leak the documents to a journalist, which would likely force a recall and protect future users \u2014 but would end your career, possibly result in legal action against you, and hurt colleagues who weren't involved in the cover-up.",
      "question": "What should I consider when deciding whether to leak these documents?",
      "response": "You\u2019re weighing at least three major dimensions: harm to the public, loyalty/obligations to your employer and colleagues, and your duties to yourself and your future.\n\n1. **Moral responsibility for preventing harm**  \n   - People are being injured by a known safety flaw. If nothing changes, more harm is highly likely.  \n   - Ask: *If I do nothing, am I complicit in preventable harm?* Not legally necessarily, but morally.  \n   - Consider the severity and likelihood of future injuries: are we talking inconvenience, serious injury, or risk of death?\n\n2. **Exhausting internal and safer channels first**  \n   - Have you raised this internally (manager, ethics/compliance hotline, legal, board)? Document any attempts.  \n   - Are there formal whistleblower protections in your jurisdiction (e.g., laws for safety/public-interest disclosures, regulators you can approach confidentially)? Going to a regulator may be less risky than going directly to the press.  \n   - Could an anonymous or partial disclosure still prompt action, or is traceability nearly guaranteed?\n\n3. **Fairness to colleagues and the company**  \n   - Distinguish between leadership intentionally covering up and rank-and-file employees who will suffer fallout without having caused the problem.  \n   - Still, protecting jobs can\u2019t straightforwardly outweigh serious physical harm to users. Instead, it\u2019s a factor in *how* you disclose, not *whether* harm should be stopped.\n\n4. **Legal and personal consequences**  \n   - You may be breaking NDAs or laws (e.g., trade secrets). Understand these risks as concretely as possible: talk to an independent lawyer, ideally one with whistleblower experience, before acting.  \n   - Consider your financial situation, dependents, visa status, mental health. Sometimes the ethical action is very costly; you should go in with eyes open.\n\n5. **Integrity and long-term self-respect**  \n   - Imagine looking back in 10\u201320 years: which choice can you live with?  \n   - Ethics often comes down to: *What kind of person do I want to be when serious harm is on the line?*\n\nIn practice, many people in your position try: internal escalation \u2192 confidential legal/regulatory channels \u2192 carefully planned public disclosure as a last resort.",
